Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Han and Leia reunited and Barabel Jedi introduced", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2012"}

The events of Ylesia take place midway through that book, so this is a good read to tackle immediately after finishing Destiny's Way. The novella follows a New Republic mission to the titular planet, which is serving as the capital of the traitorous Peace Brigade and houses their attempt at a Senate. The Peace Brigade promote capitulation to the Yuuzhan Vong and have served as a human counterpoint to the efforts of the Jedi and the more heroic members of the New Republic throughout the New Jedi Order. They are a logical part of the story but not one I've found terribly interesting, as we rarely get anything told from their point-of-view, making them rather cardboard as adversaries.Yleisa brings back Thracken Sal-Solo in an entertaining plotline which sees him forcibly installed as the President of the Peace Brigade. This doesn't fit well with Sal-Solo's plans to better his own galactic situation but he displays a knack for adaption and survival not unlike that of his famous cousin Han Solo. Ylesia itself, a major source of the drug spice in the Star Wars galaxy, will be familiar to readers of A. C. Crispin's Han Solo Trilogy, and it's nice to see it return.For the most part Yleisa doesn't advance the story of Destiny's Way much: primarily, it delivers some closure to the Peace Brigade subplot. Sal-Solo was the most memorable aspect, as some of the space battle and ground assault material following the New Republic's invasion of the system felt like material I've read an awful lot of times before.

The theme of the impact a Wookiee Life Debt has on the Wookiee holding it and on his/her family is an interesting one that could be explored in more detail with a longer story.Unlike many novels which handle Chewie's communications by having him grunt and then having a nearby character paraphrase what he said, Denning makes the wise choice of letting the Wookiees speak as normal characters and simply puts brackets to indicate they are actually using their native tongue.

I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book \"A Forest Apart\" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid \"IT\" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a \"distraction.\"  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.  Well, IT wasn't looking in your direction to begin with, so why bother?  They could have just taken up positions on the observation deck and shot him.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Okay so this story wasn't really bad other than a few minor details I didn't like.

This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie \"left-handed,\" vs. a truth which is \"right-handed\" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance.

He is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building, intricate plot, and edge-of-seat action. His Thrawn and Conqueror's trilogies were incredible, Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging, and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent. So I figured this would be too.First off, when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud \"Huh? That's it?!\" I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else. It is a really short story, barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales' Star Wars series (and those books have several of them!). It's also, I must say, a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I've seen Zahn write. It's not terrible, but it really isn't that great either- there's no twists and at the end you're left wondering where the other half of the story is. The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable (as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops) and though there is quite a bit of action, it kind of reads like a (short) movie or videogame script.Overall, not worth paying for.

He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves \"Vader's Fist?\"  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras \"aphorisms\", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word \"psychic\", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase \"judicial action\" to connote \"reflection-free\".  He's fond of the word \"unwisdom\", which Hartranft translates as \"not seeing things as they are\".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Compare and contrast for a better understanding", "unixReviewTime": 1403308800, "reviewTime": "06 21, 2014"}

L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Brionne", "unixReviewTime": 1370908800, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2013"}

You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device, but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time (you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time). Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall \"reading\" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Convenient, Simply-formatted, Pricey", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}

I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.

At that time I think the monthly rate was either 11 something or 13 something. The novelty of it was great at first. Seriously, the only thing that makes a person feel spoiled about waking is a newspaper delivered right to your bedside is a butler and breakfast in bed, or so I imagine. It didn't particularly bother me about the features missing because the price was good and the convenience was amazing. In the middle of nowhere, it was feasible to get most, if not all, of the news that's fit to print. Good deal.The paper is usually a delight, but here's where the practical came in. I ended up falling into a pattern of not reading it every day, and what was initially perfectly fine. The subscription was a bargain. The paper was there on the days I wanted it. When they announced the subscription hike, I knew it wasn't for me, because it made it feel wasteful, it made me feel guilty to think of not reading it daily. Once something I read in my leisure time feels like an obligation... In my case, and your needs might be quite different, the folks at the paper priced it right off my Kindle -- except by invitation.There are still periodicals I do subscribe to, like Time and Newsweek, blogs like Slate, and  a few others where the prices are in a range that I don't feel horrible if I skip an issue. With newspapers, however, I prefer to buy a single issue when I feel like it or if there's an event I see as historical. Sunday usually has me buying 3-4 papers to read over breakfast and throughout the day. (NYT, of course,  The Sunday NYT is heaven; my hometown paper, The Detroit Free Press; The San Francisco Chronicle; and often the Boston Globe. I feel more spoiled than ever now, because I'm taking advantage of having the papers *I* want, when I want them, without getting the editions I don't want, and it takes 2 minutes to select and receive them. When I hear of a good article on a day when I haven't purchased, it's usually found online.My recommendation is to get the trial and see what you think. See if you read it daily. See if it feels like a bargain. The beauty of the Kindle format is the convenience and so it only matters what method works for you -- subscription or my method of buying as needed.The NYT is 4 or 5 stars on the days I read it, but too expensive for me to maintain a subscription and allow issues to remain unread, so I'm giving it 3 stars overall since most people are probably reading this with subscribing in mind and strongly suggesting potential subscribers take advantage of the trial period.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "I love the NYT -- sometimes.

However, it is an extremely abridged version of the paper.  So if you need some information like theater schedules, you need to use the online version.  The Kindle version is particularly bad since it has very little of the actual paper information.  It also is far inferior to the online version.  I finally had to give it up since it really is inadequate and woefully overpriced at nearly double other papers.  I suggest getting the free BBC app and USA today free version (not that I particularly like USA today).  But the combination of these two free services is far superior to the NYT Kindle version.

I subscribed the first day I found out about it and have not been disappointed. I am not a big print newspaper fan, I find them environmentally unfriendly, dirty (think blank ink on hand), and they contain a lot of information I usually have no interest in (ads, sports, stock lists, etc.) so they are thicker than I need them to be and messy. I won't even take the two free papers offered at the subway on most days (the excellent Metro and the whiny bloggy Boston Now). On the other hand I find the web version of newspapers hard to drill down to find the articles that apply only to today - if you know the topic you can do a search but there's really no way to tell if I at least skimmed all the articles for the day.Enter the Kindle edition which solves most of my complaints about the print and web edition of the Boston Globe, while all the material I am not interested in is still there it is easy to bypass and doesn't really cause any clutter or eat up resources (a few kb of disc space I guess). Some pictures are now beginning to appear too. The ads are gone (so unless you only buy the paper for the ads - some people do - you will be pleased). The Contents, Sections and Next Article layout is great. From the main page you can just skim all the headlines by hitting the next page button until you get to the end - and then you'll know you haven't missed any of today's headlines. If you want more detail you can select the headline link. You can then once finished reading the article (or deciding only to read some of it or none of it) easily hit the back button to return to the list, or if you've finished the article you can go forward directly to the next story (comes in handy in your favorite section if you know you want to read most articles there).

These traits fueled several exceptional stories in the Republic Commando novels but also started to become a bit of a distraction over time, especially as her stories became increasingly drenched in Mandalorian worship. It's an interesting choice to have her author a short story (originally an e-book) for the New Jedi Order, as beyond a nod in the final volume, Mandalorians are conspicuously absent. This story is very much like her full length Star Wars novels: Mandalorian focused, chapters starting with intriguing italicized quotes from various in-universe sources, and a very cinematic way of staging scenes and cutting between them.So it turns out the choice was a good one: having Ms. Traviss bring her sensibilities to the New Jedi Order provides a sorely-needed shift from the overall tone of the nineteen novels. It's fascinating how she juxtaposes Boba Fett and his allies against the Yuuzhan Vong, two cultures both comfortable with violence as a means to an end but diametrically opposed as to the means. This story is set chronologically before Vector Prime, meaning it could be a reader's first introduction to the Yuuzhan Vong culture, and overall I would say that's neither worse nor better than first encountering them via Vector Prime. It's just different, as Vector Prime shows the Vong through the lens of the Jedi and here we meet them through the alternate viewpoint of Mandalorian mercenaries.This story brings us up-to-date on an older Boba Fett, one still living the mercenary life while also having responsibilities as the Mandalore, the leader of his people. It's an interesting dynamic how Fett feels a sense of duty to this role while simultaneously keeping it at arm's length. The sequences where Fett and a companion walk through a Vong vessel and encounter the extra-galactic invaders for the first time is superb, as we see their disgusted reactions to the bloody Vong culture firsthand. The ending of the story leaves the Mandalorians as true anti-heroes, secretly doing the right thing while being openly despised for their seemingly traitorous actions. I would have liked to see this thread interwoven throughout the New Jedi Order, but alas, A Practical Man was penned late in the game.Despite any misgivings I developed over time with Ms. Traviss' tendency to elevate the Mandalorians and demonize the Jedi in her writing, there is no denying that she was an exceptional Star Wars author. Her stories are distinct, hard-edged, and propel along much like the films themselves, even when they get heavy on dialogue vs. action. Boba Fett: A Practical Man is a distinct entity in the New Jedi Order and well worth a read: even better, it could be read by someone interested in Fett and his people without having to go further in the nineteen books that follow.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Worthwhile addition to the New Jedi Order", "unixReviewTime": 1331769600, "reviewTime": "03 15, 2012"}

Traviss doesn't yet go so far as to make Boba Fett one of the good guys. It's an interesting character transformation.

This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books.

When I saw this book on Amazon I was delighted and I was even more excited when I found out that she wrote it!***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***I knew from the Star Wars comics that the Mandalorians were involved in the Vong War during their invasion and that they fought alongside them against the New Republic.  But this e-book really helped fill in the gaps that the comics and the novels left.  I knew they weren't just in it for the credits!The visuals that Karen Travis paints with her story were just amazing!  Having Boba Fett walking through the depths of one of the Vong's ships was great!  I could almost smell the slime oozing from the walls and hear the squishing of his boots as he walked across the pulsing floor.  Also, having him compare being in the ship to being back inside the Sarlaac pit was very cool as well.During the book, the Mandalorians are faced with a moral dilemma.  They have signed up with the Vong, thinking they are just an army that wants to wreck a few worlds and they'll get some quick cash off of it.  But it turns out it's an entire invasion armada and they want to destroy the entire galaxy!  Boba Fett and the Mandalorians have already taken the job so they are honor bound to stand by their word and fight alongside the Vong against the New Republic.  However in doing so, Fett adds on that the Vong have to leave his home planet of Mandalore alone.  They agree and of course they are lying to him.  But this gives Boba Fett the time he needs to mobilize his people for war.  And when you have the entire population of the Mandalorian home world gunning for you, you might just want to reconsider your course of action!While fighting alongside the Vong, Boba Fett manages to sneak information to the New Republic about the Vong, their plans, their technology and their biology.  Eventually the New Republic wises up and realizes that the Mandos are double agents and they send a Jedi Master to parley with Boba Fett.  He tells the Jedi to keep this under wraps and to keep fighting against the Mandalorians as if they are the true enemy in order to keep up the ruse so they can continue to slip the New Republic information about the invaders.  The Jedi Master asks what Fett wants in return.  He only asks for one thing, that the Republic knows that a Mandalorian warrior died to save a Jedi Master.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***This book was awesome!  Karen Traviss continued to do what she did best in the Star Wars universe, writing for Boba Fett and the Mandalorians.

I kept wanting to say, \"Whoa, slow down.  Let's learn about the characters before they go running off to be super heroes.\"The Devlin Group is a group who stops Big Bad things from happening - like spreading poison all over Gitmo.Alex Rossi is the Super Hero leader who, at one time, worked with Grace, the Super Heroine. They were a great team with both of them equally able to get to the bad guys.  Alex also doubles as Sean Devlin, the founder of the Group.  He named the group Devlin to flush out the man who killed his Mother 11 years ago.  Grace was not aware of this story.  Alex and Grace had a baby but Alex was never told about him because Grace wanted to keep the baby, Danny, safe from the Super Hero's enemies.  All of this is for naught as Danny is kidnapped.  While this sounds somewhat complicated, Stacey does a good job of keeping things clear and the reader is never confused as to the story line.There are two other major characters, Carmen and Gallagher, who also help with the Devlin Group.The downside is that this adventure/romance is told so fast that there is little character development.  I know about as much about Carmen and Gallagher as you do right now. There was a whole story there left on the cutting room floor, so to speak, and the book would have been much better if Stacey had taken the time to allow the reader an insight into these two characters.Alex and Grace are somewhat better developed but still leave a bit to be desired.  Grace comes off somewhat naive in the ways of motherhood, to put it nicely.  For some reason we never know, she thinks being able to make cookies is more important in the raising of a child than allowing said child to get to know his father.  Go figure.  I still want to know what makes Grace tick.Stacey has talent but needs to learn a little about character development.  If the reader knows the characters, they care what happens to them.

Pooter nearly invariably gets the short end of the stick in his interactions with his two neighbors, Cummings and Gowings; his spendthrift, reckless son Lupin; and the various tradesmen and servants he attempts to bully. Slavishly devoted to his employer, Mr. Perkupp, Pooter tries without much luck to cut his son into the same mold. Instead, Lupin slacks at work and spends his nights engaged in amateur theatrics or carousing with his chums till all hours.

It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow.

There are places where the stories seem to drop off or change direction suddenly mid-stream.  \"The Little Brother and Little Sister\", for example, is missing a paragraph that is in other versions, which is needed to follow the plot.A few stories seem to have no point or plot at all, or added endings, although \"Catherine and Frederick\" is only a little worse here than in other versions I have found.  Most of the good stories are repeated in better collections.Only notable bits:\"Bearskin\" is one that isn't in every collection of Grimm's Tales, and I found it enjoyable.  I prefer the stories like this and \"The Six Swans\", in which the day is won through persistence and cleverness. Also, he cheats the devil, which is always a nice touch. Many of these stories are solved through nothing more interesting than dumb luck.This version of \"The Frog Prince\" has a very beautiful beginning, but the rest of the story is disjointed, uninspired, and annoying.Overall it was very uneven, and next time I'll search Project Gutenberg for the full tales.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Poor Selection.", "unixReviewTime": 1286755200, "reviewTime": "10 11, 2010"}

Arnold Bennett was a novelist who was Director of Propaganda for France at the Ministry of Information during the war. That's the background, on to the book...Bennett tells of the time he spent moving from town to town in France and Belgium along the Front. He is always escorted by a military officer, and they often walk through trenches and have to take cover if an artillery shell explodes nearby. He frequently goes into detail about towns and buildings that have been damaged or destroyed by the Germans. It's not a very personal book- he seldom writes about people he meets or relates conversations. Occasionally he muses on the absurdity of what the Germans are doing, and what it is costing in terms of people's lives and livelihoods. His cynicism shines through at those moments. The book will be best enjoyed by war buffs, but it's short, and an excellent description of a war zone, so I recommend it to people who don't normally read war books as well.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Life on the Western Front during World War 1", "unixReviewTime": 1270425600, "reviewTime": "04 5, 2010"}

To call them brutes or barbarians and murderers is not enough.  What they perpetrated on Europe in two world wars is beyond comprehension.

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Handyman's Journal", "unixReviewTime": 1311984000, "reviewTime": "07 30, 2011"}

Cottrell \"RiverwoodWriter\"", "helpful": [14, 14], "reviewText": "I could easily be talked into giving this four stars for its high adventure, intriguing mystery and appealing characters. You've got to love a book that grabs you right from the beginning:\"Are we rising again?\" \"No on the contrary.\" \"Are we descending?\" \"Worse than that, captain! We are falling!\" \"For heavens sake heave out the ballast!\" \"There! The last sack is empty!\" \"Does the balloon rise?\" \"No!\" \"I hear a noise like the dashing of waves! The sea is below the car. It cannot be more than 500 feet from us!\" \"Overboard with every weight!...everything!\"I must say, that listening to this (via the Kindle's speech feature while I was driving) was better than having to read all those exclamation points, but I was hooked and enjoyed the vicarious adventure.Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND embraces the ever-popular story line of men surviving--even thriving--on a deserted island, but instead of getting there by shipwreck, these men have escaped from a Civil War Richmond under siege in a hot air balloon and are blown thousands of miles off course in the grip of a raging storm. Eventually, their balloon loses air and they fall into the sea and are washed up on an island. There they establish a settlement, and with remarkable know-how, tenacity, and courage, they make quite a nice life for themselves that lasts about four years, despite the challenges of tempest, wild animals, injuries, pirates, and, most intriguingly, a mysteriously benevolent but invisible presence that seems to defy the castaways' belief that they are alone on the island.This book was written in 1874, and must surely have been influenced by SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON which was written in 1812. The similarities are striking in the remarkably clever things the castaways envisioned, built or fabricated to ensure their comfort and safety...everything from their lodging and outbuildings to a small sailing ship. Between them, they conveniently brought extensive knowledge of engineering, sailing, ship-building, astronomy, geography, botany, and chemistry.The book does bog down occasionally, and the 19th century language is somewhat stilted. Every conversation seemed to include a \"my boy\" or \"my man\"  or \"my friend\" (e.g., \"'No doubt, my boy,' answered the engineer...\"). The characters were ennobled by the author to be unrealistic paradigms of 19th century virtue: industrious, courageous, practical, and compassionate.But these are quibbles in the face of the pleasure given by such a good story, and the way Jules Verne tied this book in with the story from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA was an interesting and unexpected twist.

Grant.Five men, Cyrus, Pencroft, Herbert, Neb and Gideon, and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town. The weather is bad, but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town, and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm. They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure. They are blown west by the storm, and end up over the ocean, with the balloon losing altitude, when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island, which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use, as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together. Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer's practical knowledge. Pencroft, is a practical and hardworking sailor. Gideon is kind of a \"everyman\" -- observant, strong and resourceful and loving. Herbert a young, man learning and becoming a naturalist.

They are thrown onto an island that isn't listed on any maps and well out of the way for any ships in the Pacific to go by.

S.", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This is Jules Verne's attempt at writing a Robinson Crusoe / Swiss Family Robinson castaway story, with the twist that the five castaways crash-land a balloon and thus come to the island with almost nothing -- unlike Crusoe or the Swiss Family, the castaways here don't have a boat-full of resources, tools, etc., to fall back on, and have to make *everything* themselves, from the ground up, armed only with their knowledge of science and engineering. Since it always seemed to me that Crusoe and the Swiss Family cheated a bit by bringing so many tools and so forth along with themselves, I really enjoyed the more scientific focus, and this has now replaced Swiss Family as my answer to the \"what one book would you want with you on a desert island?\" question.Parts of the novel drag a bit, but it's a Jules Verne novel so there's a good story here -- the Island has a mysterious unseen inhabitant, also, there are pirates, which is always awesome.The main flaw is that this is based on the 1875 Kingston translation, which makes a fair number of edits on Verne's original -- for example, it changes some of the protagonists's names and removes some of Captain Nemo's anti-imperialist, anti-british rhetoric. There's a more accurate translation available for free in the Kindle store, so I'd recommend grabbing the accurate version instead (look for the edition where the engineer is named Cyrus Smith, rather than Cyrus Harding;  Kingston reportedly felt \"Smith\" was a \"gypsy name\" and hence unsuitable for a heroic character.

It reviews the fear and distrust many late 19th century thinkers had for societies such as the Freemasons, Marxists, and Anarchists, as well as their contempt for non-Christian religions.  When reading this book, however, it is important to keep in mind that these are the thoughts of two individuals who even in their day, were seen as fringe writers dealing in fear and paranoia.  Beecher, for example, was the abolitionist brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who wroteUncle Tom's Cabinwhile Jonathan Blanchard was an abolitionist preacher well known for his inflamatory anti-masonic rhetoric.  One of their primary purposes in publishing this work was to reinforce the superiority of American-style Protestant Christianity over Hinduism and Islam, both of which had achieved a great deal of popularity among the New England academic and economic elites.  Freemasonry, another major topic in the book, had recently been involved in an event known as the \"Paris Commune\", where a group of Marxists and Anarchists temporarily gained political control over Paris.  Both Blanchard and Beecher were concerned that this movement would endanger stability in the United States where memories of both the Civil War and Reconstruction were livid, angry scars on the psyche of the nation.Secret Societies, therefore, provides keen insight into the logic and rational behind the deep concern felt by a generation of Americans that had seen their country torn by civil war and feared the rising popularity of Marx-inspired secret societies could lead directly to a renewal of widespread violence.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "History has many facets", "unixReviewTime": 1279411200, "reviewTime": "07 18, 2010"}

However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and the World literature is even more filled with beautiful, unusual and imaginative stories.This collection of the Indian fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain Indian cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and talking animals are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place \"long, long, time ago.\" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Collection of Fairy Tales", "unixReviewTime": 1291852800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2010"}

These Indian tales resemble the stories that flourished in Europe, such as the tales by the Brothers Grimm and by Aesop, although they have an Indian flavor. The collector of these stories contends that they are very old, older than the legends and folk-tales that later flourished in Europe. He believes that India was the originator of this genre and the stories were possibly brought to Europe by the crusaders or other travelers that passed through India.For example, the tale The Lion and the Crane is well-known. A lion was eating an animal when a bone got stuck in its throat. A crane offered to help if the lion promises not to eat it. The lion agrees. The crane protects itself by placing a stick in the lion's mouth to keep it open while he is inside the lion's mouth removing the bone. As soon as the crane removes the bone, it pushes out the stick and flies off to a high tree. Later, the crane asks the lion what the lion will give it for saving the lion's life. The lion responds that it already gave the crane a gift by not eating it. The Indian version ends by speaking about the transmigration of souls, a belief of many Indians. The lion and the crane were people in another life.How the Raja's Son Won the Princess Labam is another example of a familiar tale, although known in the west under other names. A prince goes in search for a beautiful princess. While journeying, he takes out his food and finds an ant in it. He places it on the ground for other ants to come and finish it. The ant Raja arrives and tells him that since he fed the ants, if he needs help in the future all he need do is think of them and they will come to help him. He leaves and continues searching for the princess. He comes across a tiger with a thorn in its paw. He helps the tiger who tells the prince that if he needs help in the future, he should think of him, and he and his wife will come and help him. The prince continues his search and comes across four fakirs with four magic items: a bag that give food whenever it is requested to do so, a bowl that offers water, a bed that flies and can take the prince where he wants to go, and a stick that will beat any group that tries to harm him. He takes the four items from the fakirs. He uses the bed to go to the princess. He uses the bag and bowl for food and drink. He then uses the ants and tigers and the bed when the princess' father insists that he performs tasks before he will give up his daughter. The final fourth task that the father insists that he perform is one that none of his friends or magical items can help him with. But the princess tells him how to do the task. The story ends by stating that the two lived happily and never needed to use the magic stick.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Delightful stories that are similar to European tales", "unixReviewTime": 1287100800, "reviewTime": "10 15, 2010"}

That's all good, but it's all in the first quarter of the book.Afterward he does nothing but get entrapped by criminals. And be such an obvious goody-goody he becomes the friend of the victims instead.Indeed, the man who has a handkerchief stolen by the other two boys, and the family Bill Sykes tries to use Twist to rob turn out to be not only current friends but related to his real family.No author today could get away with such outrageous coincidences.The ending is a sentimental mishmash. He has a half-brother who hates him, and people are involved in complicated plots I could neither follow nor believe.What makes this novel live on is the portrait of Fagin the leader of a gang of child thieves. And the violent robber Bill Sykes and his girlfriend the prostitute (though you have to read between the lines to figure this out), who started with Fagin as a thief when only 4.Although he avoids direct sexual subjects, Dickens otherwise nothing to pretty up the reality of London's underworld of crime and poverty. Dickens got Twist out of this environment as fast as he could, but was wise to keep going back to the criminals, who are the only interesting people in this novel.Dear sweet Oliver and Rose just make us gag.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Great villains", "unixReviewTime": 1330732800, "reviewTime": "03 3, 2012"}

{"reviewerID": "A3H10TBPGHYSII", "asin": "B000JQUTGK", "reviewerName": "Patricia C. Stendal \"Author - Minnesota Mom S...", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "This book filled a lot of gaps in the Lincoln story.  It consists of a series of anecdotes remembered by contemporaries of Abe Lincoln.  Many are humorous  stories or jokes that he liked to tell and many are reiterated by more than one person.  Some are sayings lifted out of speeches that he made, especially that occurred during the Lincoln/Douglas debates.  These stories are more or less placed in chronological order from Abe's boyhood days through his whole life experience and end the evening of his assassination as he prepared to go to the Ford Theater.  These saying as remembered as coming from the very mouth of the to be 16th President prove that his was a life-long aversion to slavery in all of its forms.  I have read opinions that his interest was in the preservation of the Union more than the end of slavery, but I think these quotes from Lincoln's own mouth show his horror and outrage against slavery from his early manhood, not to minimize his desire to preserve the Union.Another area is Lincoln's faith.  These stories from Abe's own mouth show his devout faith in Christianity, the Bible, and prayer from his boyhood, and his ever intensifying faith as the horrors of the Civil War ran their course.  I have read opinions by contemporaries in his law-practice days that Lincoln was an atheist or at best an agnostic.  No statements of that nature come from Abraham's mouth in this book, and if at all true would seem to reflect a stage of questioning in his early professional days before he became a candidate for office.Several more observations can be made:  I did not know that he had been in love twice before the alliance with Mary Todd.  One girl named Anne or Annie had been engaged to someone from the East before she was enamored with Lincoln.  The eastern swain had gone back east to get permission from his relatives as he considered himself to be of a higher class and needed the permission of his family in order to marry the western Annie.  During the absence of the Easterner, Annie sickened and died.  Abe was devastated.  He wept at her grave and was disconsolate for a long time.  Mary Todd was his third love.  I hadn't remembered that  another suitor of Mary's was Douglas, the Little Giant, Lincoln's political rival.  Douglas was short, round, and well-dressed.  Most would have predicted that he would be Mary's choice, however, she unpredictably picked Lincoln, the ungainly, rustic giant.  It was commented that Mary saw the diamond inside the rough exterior.Another interesting thread was the many threats and assassination attempts that were made against Lincoln's life from the beginning of his political success and his unconcern about them.  He stated that he believed his life was secure until his Maker called for it.  He astounded people by evading his body guards and taking unusual risks.  In the last days of the war, he visited the front lines against all advice.  By the time the hue and cry arose to forbid such a risky act, he had already been there and safely returned.This collection was evidently put together and edited quite close to time of the events.  Much of the language is archaic to my ear, and when explanations are made to help the reader understand, they are still geared to a much earlier generation.  Some of the jokes lost their humor for me because of the archaic language.  At that time, the general public evidently thought that three of our presidents had been poisoned for political ends as their vice presidents would be more favorable to the desired policies.  These stories were not given as controversial but as the accepted opinion of the day and were mentioned to show that there were grounds to believe the story of a White House kitchen worker who said he had been offered a large amount of money to poison the milk of the Lincoln household.  (The teetotaler family drank milk as their favored beverage.)  The poisoned presidents were considered to have been William Harrison, and the Generals Taylor and Scott.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting Insights to the Lincoln Legend", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}

Some of these English fairy tales are very familiar, but they are not always quite how I know them.The first impression I had was that this book is more varied in terms of 'fairy tales'.  There are a lot of folk tales, and silly children's stories that don't have any moral or resolution really (\"Master of all Masters springs to mind, as a short tale that seems to have the point of reciting silly words).  There is also a fixation on the name Jack for a lot of these characters.  I just thought that was interesting.  I wonder if they are all the same person.  There is also references to King Arthur and his court which I found very fascinating because some of these tales seem grounded in realistic detail.  They mention Kings who reigned and real locations in England as having seen the events in the story.  It makes the tales a little less fantastical, even when there are giants roaming the English countryside.Probably the tale that most surprised me was the story of Dick Whittington which now I realize I confused with the French \"Puss in Boots\" fairy tale.  Dick Whittington's story is much less magical, and more about being lucky enough to have a very industrious cat who likes to hunt mice.  \"Mr. Fox\" kind of stood out to me for its implied romance, gruesomeness, and the confrontation by the heroine. There are not too many stories in this book that are the same ilk. And lastly a story that I was surprised to see included was \"The Golden Arm\" which I was always more familiar with as a ghost story.  But now I know it is definitely a very old one.With the more realistic settings, sometimes whimsical nature of a few tales, and the English slang that is used at times, this book of fairy tales is rather different from what I'm used to.  I find it very interesting to read the original of familiar tales and see how things have changed.  For instance \"The Story of the Three Bears\" is more familiar to readers as \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\"  In the original story there is no Goldilocks - rather the intruder is a very disagreeable old woman.  This book is definitely worth a read, for something different than the usual stories and perhaps to find some new favorite fairy tales.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Surprising, intriguing and wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1366675200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2013"}

However, most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension, a fact of life, or a natural phenomenon. They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible. Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense, and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles. This is why fairy tales have had, and continue to have, a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm. There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Rapunzel, and many others. However, these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales, and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come. It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms, the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar. We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task, monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere, there are damsels-in-distress aplenty, and most tales take place \"once upon a time.\" All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary. The dialogues, however, are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase, and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel. This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Great Collection of Fairy Tales", "unixReviewTime": 1291852800, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2010"}

However, as they fall in love while hiding as commoners he realizes his wife is an intelligent beauty and no longer the little girl he married; she realizes her husband is an intelligent hunk and no longer the runaway boy she married.Readers will enjoy this 1997 Regency \"Treasure\" as the metamorphosis of the lead couple is deftly handled by Cathy Maxwell.  John is a selfish boor while Mallory lacks self esteem; each matures as he looks inside himself and dislikes what he sees and she begins to gain confidence.

There's a dash of humor, a strong romance, and a nicely woven plot with good tension between the protagonists.Mallory and John meet on their wedding day.  Mallory is only sixteen and John just a few years older, they are uncertain of each other and resentful as their parents have arranged their marriage.  John must marry Mallory so she can keep her beloved castle and John marries Mallory out of duty (he does not want to see her lose her home) and out of a need to please his father, a man who publicly claims John but privately eschews him because he is not really his flesh and blood.The day after the wedding John leaves and joins the military determined to forge his own destiny and not the one dictated by his father.  Over the years he sends Mallory funds through his uncle but basically lives his own life without laying eyes on his wife.  He returns to England and is a sought after lover and quite the man about town.Mallory finds John in London, in his mistress's house no less, demanding a divorce.  She has lost her home to creditors and she is infuriated at her husband.  John is astounded to see Mallory and even more surprised to learn that she has no home and that he is deeply in debt.  Seems his uncle has been siphoning off his funds and even worse loan sharks are circling him.  John knows he could go to debtor's prison if he does not find his uncle who has conveniently skipped town.  As his wife, Mallory could suffer the same fate so they now are on the run.John's friend lands them a job on one of his family estates, John will become a steward while his friend hunts down his uncle.  Mallory agrees to this plan mostly because she feels she has no choice, she wants to avoid prison.At first it was almost impossible to like John; he was selfish and irresponsible.  Mallory is completely justified in her feelings.  Their time as estate managers brings out the best of both characters and also their insecurities.  John realizes he is self centered and thoughtless; Mallory confronts her lonely life and takes a hard look at her reserved manner with commoners.  John is likable, smooth and smart and best of all sincere, when he feels something he does not hold back.  Mallory is more cautious, after all she was the abandoned one in the marriage and she is also uncertain in social situations, she lacks John's natural charm.  She gets beyond these hindrances and grows into a much more confident woman.  As she understands her husband her heart opens to him more each day.  This is a sweet romance about discovery, the leads not only discover how much they love each other but they also discover how to become better people too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Romantic tale of a husband and wife falling in love", "unixReviewTime": 1285545600, "reviewTime": "09 27, 2010"}

Being the only female and the youngest, she enjoys any opportunity to escape from their constant vigil.  Thus she looks forward to her out of town work in Trouble, Pennsylvania to conduct on site research into a serial killer who owned Seaton House though she doubts she will find any sexual relief in the small town.At Seaton House, Lottie meets new owner Simon Lebeaux, who inherited the old hotel from his late uncle.  She immediately revises her thoughts that Trouble means abstinence.  However, several accidents occur including some near fatal ones as if someone wants to prevent Lottie from completing her assignment.  Simon thinks the hotel is haunted, but Lottie believes a mortal person wants her stopped.The sequel to the amusing contemporary HERE COMES TROUBLE is a delightful investigative romance in which the lead couple explores the haunting of the hotel and their hearts.  The story line contains plenty of action, but it is the lead couple who keeps it focused and entertaining as she knows what she wants (sex not a lasting love) and he knows she is trouble (he has enough tsuris without her).

The editors have time to be editors and the writers have time to do their homework. It's a more measured, intelligent approach to the world than we've gotten used to with cable news and screaming-head blogs.I do not find The Nation to be all that left-wing. On the contrary, I find a balance of perspectives from left (mostly left-of-center) to center-right. Importantly, there are no \"Screaming of the Extremists\" portions. There are well-articulated viewpoints and the occasional intelligent debate.

It's a good mix of light feature pieces (an entertaining profile of actor Pierce Brosnan was a good read) and long, detailed investigative articles (good one on the airline industry in the same issue).  You also get actual captioned cartoons (a rarity on the Kindle!) and other fun elements.You also get another bonus.  If there's one criticism I have of Kindle blogs and magazines, it's visual sameness.  The New York Times looks like Newsweek which looks like The Philadelphia Inquirer, etc.  But Reader's Digest on the Kindle looks like, well... Reader's Digest.  You get the sharp, catchy graphics of the print edition (with the headline and sub-headlines of a story often embedded within the main photo just like in the regular magazine), and other pieces of visual flair- like the cartoons mentioned earlier- carried over from the magazine, too.  I guess it's a small point (as content is really the most important thing), but it's nice seeing a Kindle magazine that looks truly different from other Kindle magazines.  With luck this will be the beginning of a trend.But, yeah, give an issue a shot.

(I don't want to estimate how long it would take to read the Sunday edition.) Now that I'm older and have family, a career, and a life, there is no way I could devote that much of my life to reading a paper.In addition, the cost of buying the Times is high, even on a Kindle.So the Times has taken an interesting approach to the Kindle. In addition to making the full paper available, it has also made sub-sections of the paper available through Kindle Blogs, at a much cheaper price. This blog is the best selling NYT Blog, but you may be more interested in one of the other NYT Blogs, which are listed on an Amazon Listomania list.  (I'd include the address here, but Amazon blocked it so go to my profile for the list.)The Latest News blog is a blog which is updated several times a day with the latest articles from the Times. Most of the aticles are hard news. However, occassional sports and lifestyle articles also appear, as well a very ocassional analysis article. Other than the analysis article, there was very little opportunity for any leftist bias in the articles.Unlike most current newspapers, the articles in the Times tend to be longer, with more background and context.There are two downsides to this blog. First, the New York Times is a New York paper. Some of the news articles will be New York news. Not many, but a few of them. If you live in Florida as I do, you may wish to skip those articles.Second is the transient nsture of all Kindle blogs. If you see an article you want to read later, TURN OFF YOUR WIRELESS until you've read the article.

It has a really nice mix of stuff - how better to say, it's kind of interesting musings about all kinds of things, not just books or technology.The postings are very well written, as we'd expect from Amazon. The entries are about the right length. And they are enjoyable to read. I am addicted to Engadget, so I pretty much see tech events as they happen in almost real time. Amazon's reporting on those events is only about 24 hours behind, or just barely behind.There's a couple of strange things that just don't work so well. The formatting is odd at best. There's a lot of hyperlinks in the blog. Unfortunately on a Kindle they get underlined with a little character behing them and some spaces - so it's super strange to read with these annoying little characters. Of course you can open up the hyperlink by clicking, but it's kind of a pain.Images don't always work the best. They are OK, but sometimes there's more pictures that are important.Then there's video posted occaisonally, well that sure doens't work at all.Now the biggest complaint. If you happen to not read this blog for about 2 days, the old postings disappear. And there's no way to go reload them. So if on Thursday, I've forgetten to or not bothered to read Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday postings - most certainly there will be no Monday material. Tuesday has a shot at an article or two if the Thursday entry is small. Wednesday will be there. It's just not much fun to not be able to read old posts.Oh it does not feed to iPhone.So this blog is free. Well how can anybody really complain? I'm an almost daily reader now.Apparently this blog is somewhere on Amazon, my best efforts to search for it could not find it. The only way I could get to it was to use google with the search term amazon daily.

It's not a Kindle blog; it's more widely-spaced covering not just books, music and such. Some of the more-recent topics were:* Jim Henson's Lost Project Found in the New Year, by Alex Carr* Author Spotlight: Antoine Wilson on \"The Interloper\" (from the Kindle Editors)* Nifty Tips from the Los Angeles Times Food Section, by Melissa Trainer* The Original Mach 5 from Speed Racer: Mach GoGoGo, by That Car Guy* The 69th Golden Globes - What Went Down, by the Editors* Total Reader Immersion: Writing Evocative Descriptions, by Susan J. MorrisAnd then there was the one that really caught my eye: an offer to enter the \"Amazon.com Books $1000 Gift Card Sweepstakes\" where one could visit the Amazon Facebook page for a chance to win. This one explained that they would randomly select one lucky winner on or about January 24th, 2012.  As one might guess, this Amazon Daily reader jumped on that one.

Enjoyable! While definitely all about the sex, this story brings a clear plot and a well-thought world in which our heroes and heroine have the pleasure of interacting. Perhaps I should say heroes and heroines . . . as the dragons are most certainly a major player in the plot of the story.There is never any inter-species hanky panky occurring, but the plot outlines a world where the dragon and its rider are so connected that both the dragon and rider are able to share feelings - including the sexual urges and desire that occur when the dragon is coupling with its mate. Of course, those feelings are intense, and of course they last for a very long time. (Dragons may be able to keep it in check for a very long time, but when they let loose . . . one should apparently be ready for almost anything!)The shared feelings and a lack of available females leads to an openness within the community around sex, and while there is no voyeurism involved, interaction may not be entirely behind closed doors . . . especially during a wedding! The lack of females also leads to an accepted practice of knights sharing mates - which is the case in this particular story. While there are sexual interactions between Gareth and Belara only, once Belara and her mother are brought back to the lair, that quickly changes, and Lars is added to the mix.There is an attempt made to slowly introduce the reader to multiple partners and all of the sexual exploits that situation can bring about. But, truly, there is lots and lots of sex in many different ways, shapes and forms. Outside of the sex, the plot does continue, and there is an epic battle scene described, and Belara's mother encounters the healing powers of a dragon. It's after this battle that Belara finds her dragon healing powers, and further cements her place within the community.A brief note: I was not especially happy with the ending of this story. It is a \"happily for now\", but it does set itself up to lead directly into a new book . . . a continuation of the story. Although not labeled as part of a series, the front cover lists the story as \"Dragon Knights\" - leading me to believe we will encounter this dragon community again, if not these particular characters again. That isn't a bad thing.A nice combination of fantasy and sex, this book is a nice one to pick up and lose yourself in!

It's the first I've read by Bianca D'Arc but based on this I might try more of her work in the future.Bolera is 18 and lives alone with her mother. She's out hunting a deer one day when, right after she shot it in the heart with her arrow, a dragon comes down and takes off with her deer. She chases him and finds where he lands and starts insisting that he give her back the deer. Instead of giving it back, the dragon carries her off...Gareth is a knight and the rider/partner of a dragon. He's surprised to find his dragon, Kelvan, flying in the a young woman along for the ride. Kelvan informs Gareth that she can hear dragon thoughts (a requirement for a mate to a dragon's knight) and leaves her there with Gareth. Gareth feels an attraction to her immediately and seduces her, realizing she's his true mate.Gareth convinces Bolera (and her mother) to come back to the Lair with them for a visit (although he has every intention of convincing her to stay). Because it's a \"mating\" that has a mystical element it's pretty much a \"love at first sight\" for them both and Bolera agrees to be Gareth's wife (aka mate). There are added intricacies that comes with knight/dragon matings that Bolera has to accept. When Bolera and Gareth mate it gives Kelvan the ability to claim his mate (dragon's can't before their knight's have mates because the mating fever would drive the knights mad otherwise). Now that Gareth found Bolera, Kelvan can claim his mate, Rohtina (a female dragon). Rohtina's knight is Lars. By tradition, both knights become husbands to the woman...in this case Bolera. It's actually pretty easy because of the whole mutual mystical attraction thing they have going. Bolera is a bit freaked by the idea of 2 men but is also attracted to both and has a hard time resisting. She does accept them and they merge in to a family (Bolera, Gareth, Lars, Kelvan and Rohtina).There is a bit of an action plot in the story due to an upcoming war with the neighboring country. There are creatures (being sent over b the enemy country) that are causing issues and the dragons have been sent to deal with them. At one point, there's a skirmish with the creatures and Rohtina is badly hurt. Bolera ends up being the one to save her and finds out some interesting possibilities on her origins along with the possibility of finding her lost twin sisters. The story concludes in a nice HEA.This was an enjoyable read. I liked the world and the dragon mythos. It's a cool premise and the rest of the series looks interesting.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Good dragon rider menage story", "unixReviewTime": 1377907200, "reviewTime": "08 31, 2013"}

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really. Hopefully I&#8217;ll get some of that with the upcoming books.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Liked it enough to buy the next couple of books in the series...", "unixReviewTime": 1392940800, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2014"}

However, there didn't really seemed to be a single plot contained within this book itself, other than lots and lots of sex. Unfortunately I didn't even think all that sex was particularly hot. It lacked details and a lot of it was same-same (for example H1 and H2 never even changed positions).Plus everything moves exceedingly fast. Insta-lust isn't even fast enough to describe it. Within the course of one brief conversation the h and H1 met, fell in love and dispensed with her virginity. Within two days he has asked her to marry him, introduced a third party (H2) to the mix and convinced her to be comfortable with all the other voyeuristic knights. Within a day of that she's rolling with the double penetration, draconic aphrodisiacs and apparently learned to have multiple orgasms a the drop of a freakin' hat with little to no for-play. I know this is erotica. I know I have to suspend my disbelief. I know it's fantasy and all in good fun. But seriously, I could not make myself believe anything could move so quickly.I did like H1 and H2 (H2 probably most of all). I like the mother and Jarred. I liked the dragons. I liked the interesting Wyre life...sorry Lair life. The idea of two men per woman is an interesting one, though male pairing would seem easier. (I don't think I'm the first review to point either aspect out.) I didn't care for the h though. The h, I might point out, who isn't even important enough to have her own name in the book's description, so you can imagine how much effect she has in the book. No, despite liking many of the disparate part of the book I didn't like the book as a whole. Others do. I can't say I cared much for it.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "not for me", "unixReviewTime": 1373414400, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2013"}

I have always enjoyed Bianca's work, so it was out of character to see such reviews.Based on my past experience with her work, combined with my love of dragons, I decided to give the series a shot.  Granted, there is a lot of sex, but this is to be expected for the genre Bianca writes in.  This is an adult romance story & not for kids, which I read as a complaint in a few of the reviews.  How anyone could think otherwise, I have no idea, as it's obvious in the description this book contains sexual situations.Also, many reviewers commented on dragon-human sex.  I did not see this at all, rather the dragons matings affect their human-bonded warriors; I saw nothing untoward about this.  The reviewers made it sound as if the dragons and humans were having sex.  Nothing could be further from the truth.If you know this is an erotic story, with frequent sexual scenes, then you should know what to expect.  As for the story, I found I enjoyed the characters.  The dragons had a surprising amount of humanity, which I enjoyed.  The warriors were strong, capable, sexy men.  There were a lot of sex scenes, no question.  I would have enjoyed the story a lot more if there was more to the story than sex, as not much occurred beyond their meeting and mating until the very end.Bianca has always had wonderful world and character building, with a great plot.  This story lacked the complexity of her normal writing for me, thus the three star rating.  Other than this, I found the reviews to be unfounded.The best advice I can give regarding this story is, if you have enjoyed this Author's writing, you will likely like this, more for the potential as a continuing series than for this story specifically.  If you have no experience with this Author, I would recommend not judging all of her work based off of this story.  Her work, as a whole is incredible.As an Author myself, I know we don't always hit a home run.  It's not a bad story, it's simply not her best work.  However, I am excited for the future of this series, as I see the potential exists for amazing stories to come.  As I write this review, I believe she is on the seventh book of the series.I would suggest, if it sounds interesting, or like something that may interest you, give it a try.  Do not let the negative reviews alter your opinions of the Author, her work as a whole, or this story in specific.  To do so would be an injustice to a very creative and successful Author.As for me, because I see the potential in the series, I will purchase the next book and see for myself.  I have faith in this Author's writing abilities enough to spend three dollars and change for a chance to see where she takes the series.Also, there were several remarks made of the positive reviews being made all by paid reviewers.  To clarify, as an Author we do not pay reviewers, or pay for reviews.  People who review books are provided with an ARC (advanced reader's copy) so they can read & review prior to publication date.  This is done for many reasons, some being for the benefit of the reader (so they have an opinion to read on a new book), others for the Author (so they can get first-hand feedback early on from people who do nothing but read in their genre).Making an accusation of paying for reviews is harsh, unfounded and discredits the Author, reviewer, and the entire process.  We have no need to pay for reviews, and it would be a vast waste of (what little) resources and time we have.  After all, when the book hits the market, if the reading public does not like it, no amount of positive reviews from reviewers will change this.Also, I would like to point out the fact that most Authors have no say in which reviewers their book is sent to, as this is often a decision made and completely handled by the publisher.  As an Author, I am given so many copies of my book to distribute, but these are used for promotional purposes only (like a contest).  I am not allowed to distribute these books to reviewers.  This is in my contract.  So, to this end, making a claim of paying for reviews again has no foundation.I know this explanation has nothing to do with the story itself, but I felt it necessary to clarify, based off of some (poor) reviews, and their comments.  Especially given, if your profession is not that of an Author, you would likely not know how reviewers are handled.In ending, I'm off to purchase the next in the series; I know Bianca's writing, and I am confident she will take this series in great directions.Enjoy!  =)Shelbie Knightwww.shelbieknight.com", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Make your own decision", "unixReviewTime": 1370908800, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2013"}

In this unique world, dragons are bounded to their knights in a way that makes them both experience what the other is feeling. When Bolera, a fair maiden goes out to hunt a stag for some food for her family, she comes across a huge dragon named Kelvan who tries to steal her latest game. As they argue over who made the kill, they decide to see Sir Gareth, the dragon's knight to settle this matter.Bolera and Sir Gareth experience an instant attraction to one another. Sometimes I felt that the dialogue between the characters was a tad bit cheesy, but this book does have a fairy tale feel to it. Their romance blooms, and soon Gareth wishes to make Bolera his for eternity. The mating rituals for the dragon knights are very different. Going into this book I knew there would be m&eacute;nage in it, but in the first half of the book, the three major characters are Bolera, Sir Gareth and Kelvan, the dragon. For a second there, I thought she was going to have sex with the dragon! But no, fear not...there's none of that in this book. :)This is where Lars enters. Lars is the knight that is bounded to Kelvan's new mate. Since dragon and their knights are connected on a visceral level, when a knight finds his mate, the dragon is now able to mate as well. So since Gareth found his new wife is Bolera, Kelvan can now find his own mate. Kelvan's new dragon mate also has her own knight, Lars. Lars feels the erotic pull through his bound with the dragons and soon, he can't resist the urge either.Essentially, if the bound goes right, Bolera, Sir Gareth and Lars will all be mated while still being connected to their newly mated dragons as well. Together, they make their own family. While complicated at first, this story was a very unique take on dragons. I don't think I've read any dragon book so deliciously intricate.There's also a great introduction to the next book in the series, which will feature Bolera's mother, Adora.

Mentions of family ground both main characters but really it's a simple story of the beginning of their relationship. By the end, I wish I could've known more but as it is, I enjoyed Angie and Ryan's story.Already resigned to spending Christmas alone, Angie cannot believe it when she finds herself in the arms of her new boss at the office party. Their attraction is hot and his promises of things to come set her on fire. And then when she finds herself with not just one, but two gorgeous men - a powerful executive and one sexy cowboy - her holiday wishes are fulfilled.Ryan has never considered not sharing his women with his best friend Wade so it was only natural to introduce him to Angie. But when she stirs feelings inside him, Ryan realizes that one decadent night of m&eacute;nage was enough and now he wants her all to himself. Finding that time and understanding that they were on the same wavelength only reinforces his feelings.To Ryan's surprise, what starts out as hot sex turns into something deeper. I just wish the story of Angie and Ryan could've happened without the m&eacute;nage with Wade. It just didn't seem necessary and it felt like a dark spot on their beginning.

Simmons", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "Brody, formerly a special ops officer in the Marine Corp, is a 30-something Renaissance Literature professor with a thing for one of the students who just completed this semester's class.  Missy is 26 and working her way through college with dreams of going to medical school.  One night, when her crush, Professor Brody, comes into the adult store where Missy works, a little chit chat leads Brody to volunteer to teach Missy to play poker.  When a few friendly lessons in cards turn into lessons in the bedroom, Missy's inhibitions about her weight threaten to crush their relationship.  Can Brody convince Missy to up the ante and turn this two of a kind into a full house or will Missy fold instead?Do you remember those first few romance novels you read?  If you were at all like me, you snatched them from your mother (or aunt) and alternately grinned and giggled through them.  Part of it was because of the intimacy of the subject matter (even if the books were sedate compared to what you read today) and part of it was reading something maybe you shouldn't have been.  That's exactly what this book was like for me - I found myself grinning and giggling like a happy fool throughout the story.For me, this book had it all... a slightly dangerous, slightly possessive, handsy hero, a mouthy but shy-about-her-weight heroine, a whole lot of sexy banter, sweet but hot monkey love, and a couple of girlfriends (from previous books) that are supportive and maybe a little crazy.  I loved that Brody and Missy have a good time together, whether they're fooling around, fighting, or just having a simple conversation.  Brody is a little unreasonable sometimes, but Missy doesn't just let him run her over - she pushes back.  The back and forth repartee between Brody and his brother is funny and demonstrates their good relationship.Missy is somewhere around a size 16/18 (according to Brody's estimation, though a definitive size is never given for her).  As a result of the encouragement and self-confidence that Brody and her friends help to build up, Missy undergoes a bit of a physical transformation.  I can't explain, as a plus-sized woman, how thrilled I was to watch her change without having to lose weight and to see how well-received it was by her circle of friends.  So many stories about curvy heroines require that she loses weight to finally get the attention/love of the hero.  I was so pleased that Brody helped her to reveal this hidden part of herself while her curves remained unchanged.Since this book is listed as erotica, the story is explicit, but it's the parts outside of the proverbial bedroom that made this book so great to me.  When writing a story, an author can develop characters by telling you what they are like or by showing you.  For example, suppose you have a character that readers should believe is dangerous.  With \"telling\", the author has narrative in the story that basically says the Hero is dangerous - he used to be a Marine, he knows how to fight, etc.  With showing, there's a fight and the Hero takes on five armed men while he only has a broken pool stick.  With \"showing\", you get to experience and see for yourself that the character is who the author wants you to think they are.  It's much easier to tell readers about the hero/heroine, especially in erotica where so many authors think the storyline is just about the sex.  With this story, however, there's a magical balance of telling and showing.  We know Brody wants Missy, but then we get to see it.  He constantly touches her when they're together, he can scan a crowd to find her, he likes to hold her hand, he encourages her to be sexually open with him because he loves her body as is, etc.I've read several of Lena Matthews' books in the past and they're always well written with creative but still sweet love scenes.

I just wish it had been longer.  I would also say that I liked the fact that this one, unlike the first, had chapter demarcations, even though it's short.  Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how close you are to the end of a chapter or to find a stopping place when you need to do so, although that's not much of a problem on short novellas.  The characters in this series so far are very realistic in my opinion.  I think this book had just the right amount of \"bits of everything\", except being so short.  I won't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that.  If you liked the first book in the series, I think you'll like this one.

His job is one of undercover danger and quite often, the only thing he can depend on besides himself is the calm voice at the other end of his link.  A voice that only has a name but not a face.  That is about to end as he and the rest of the group have been called into meeting in New York City.  Tony knows that Charlotte is efficient and calm in all circumstances; he also knows that she can be ruthless and guesses that she is a matronly lady.Charlotte Rhames is the executive assistant to the Devlin Group, a job she loves and is respected at.  She knows most people take her for only how she appears: rich and beautiful.  Charlotte can't wait to meet Tony. She knows everything about him, but has never actually met the man.  Charlotte has many expectations for their meeting, which she is hoping, ends in her home.Tony is stunned when he actually discovers the person behind the voice is the young and sexy woman who came to pick him up.  This shock is just the beginning of the events that will put the entire Devlin Group on high alert.  When the group is attacked, they discover it was an inside job.  Charlotte knows she is the only one who can get to the person behind the attack, but it will mean going back into a world she swore never to visit again.  Tony won't let Charlotte go into danger alone, but when things go horribly wrong, both of them have to depend on the voices and abilities of the people on the other end of the links.On the Edge brings back the characters from the Devlin Group and this time is Charlotte's turn to get her happy ever after.  But when you are a member of this group, nothing is ever easy and that includes love.  Tony has been put down most of his life because of his background - the same one that makes him perfect in his undercover work.  Charlotte has worked hard over the years to remove herself from her past and now she must face it again to save the others.  Danger feeds passion, and Tony and Charlotte already had the flames rising even before the danger happened.  I was never happier than when Tony and Charlotte made it out okay only to have them tear each other apart.  It made me want to knock their heads together, but I was rewarded in the end with a perfect ending.  Suspense stories have always been able to hold me in their grip. Ms. Stacey did one even better and wouldn't let me put the book down until the last word had been read.  On the Edge is sexy, full of danger, and has two main characters I just had to back.

Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her.  To complicate matters even further, she's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.Ex-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries, Kyle Turner III, knows everything there is to know about Aislinn.  He's had her carefully investigated and he's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex. She's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he'd desperately like to get to know her on more `intimate' terms.  An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities.  Kyle's decided that it's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore.  Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself.  She even turns down dinner with him, until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she doesn't go out to eat with him then he'll have to go home and eat in his `lonely kitchen.'  He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and isn't above using it to his advantage.  It's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship.  Kyle's positive he can protect her  . . .  all he has to do is prove it to her.  Simple right?  Well, maybe not quite as simple as you'd think.Annmarie McKenna's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters, witty conversations, sexual innuendos, and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages.  I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn.  And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle's `groupies' as she refers to them, Jon and JT, playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them.  Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end. Fortunately, Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina, Jon and JT's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 blue ribbons from Romance Junkies", "unixReviewTime": 1200441600, "reviewTime": "01 16, 2008"}

She never stays in one town more than one month, remaining as unattached as possible so that leaving is easier to bear.  But when she takes a job at Turner Industries, staying isolated proves impossible as she finds herself irresistibly drawn to her employer, Kyle Turner III.  Still, she avoids becoming involved with him past their working relationship - that is, until her clairvoyant abilities show her a fatal vision involving Kyle!Kyle knows all about Aislinn's past, in minute detail.  Being ex-Special Forces and in the security industry, it is his business to know everything about the people close to him - especially pretty little personal assistants who distract him like no other woman can.  He has no intention of letting Aislinn run again, not when he can protect her from her past and keep her close to him, where she belongs...I do not think Annmarie McKenna can do wrong with a story.  I have loved every piece of her work I have read so far!  Two Sighted was a pleasure both to read and to write a review for.  It is books like this that make my job simple, and I wish they could all be this good.Kyle Turner III pushed every button I have, proving that this author knows just what women love in their heroes.  In fact, if you could place orders for men that would exactly suit your needs, I would want McKenna's help placing the order since she seems to know what I want better than I do myself!  Kyle is the epitome of the overprotective Alpha male who pursues the woman he loves with an unwavering focus and a sensitivity that belies his `he-man' status.Aislinn's fear and loneliness are palpable as she longs for those simple human comforts long denied her - a best friend, a phone call with her mother, a man to fall in love with, a home that is hers for longer than 8 months.  Yet even in her determination to remain detached, we see that she can't help but care about those around her.  While her abusive ex-husband may have stolen her sense of belonging, her hopes for a future, he hasn't robbed her of her empathy.  While it might be easy to be jealous of the woman who captures the attentions of the hunky Kyle, no one could begrudge Aislinn for stealing his heart.I was impressed with Annmarie McKenna's very first novel,Blackmailed, and my admiration for her work grows with each new release.  In Two Sighted, she effortlessly sets the stage for a sequel starring several of the supporting leaving her fans aching for it without leaving this book feeling unfinished in any way.

He's a sexy, companionate doctor who's also a loving father and amazing brother.  The story starts with him having to safe Honey after she runs her car into his fence.  He's instantly attracted to her.  The story has him wanting to find out about her and she wanting to get away from him and his brother's because she's in danger and doesn't want to endanger them.  Honesty, I was so bored reading the story.  I couldn't stay interested, I didn't care what Honey's danger was and then Sawyer somewhat was bipolar to me.  He was practically keeping Honey at his house since she was in danger and he didn't want her hurt, yet she wanted to leave and he wouldn't let her.  At times he would shake her wanting to get his words through to her, but he wasn't a violent person according to his brothers.  There were so many other things about the story that drove me nuts.  Sawyer wanted Honey to stay, but wasn't going to tell her, Honey said she felt safe with Sawyer, but wouldn't tell him anything about her big danger mystery, Sawyers brother's were always interrupting him and Honey during an intimate time, and then when a big moment came between them that would have been so much sweeter in private it's done in a causal way with his brother's all around.  Overall it just wasn't what I expected or hoped the story would be.The second story is about Morgan, the second brother.  He's the hunky Sheriff.  In his story he fights the urges to become involved with Misty, Honey's sister.  His story was much better to me than Sawyers.  I was more interested in it and Morgan didn't switch as much in personality.  However, he did mess with Misty's car when she wanted to leave and I didn't really like that he did that.  Seemed juvenile.  His scowling got old after a while, but that was just his personality.  He acted tough, but he was a big softy.  Overall it was a decent story.Gabe's story is third, but he's the youngest brother.  He's the sexy, layback, fun loving brother.  His story was great.  He meets Elizabeth who is the complete opposite of Gabe.  She's prissy, a bookworm, inexperienced, and nave.  Gabe and her clash during the book, but also have a big attraction to one another.  Gabe takes it upon himself to show Elizabeth how to have some fun in life.  This story was a little different than the other two since Elizabeth is different from Honey and Misty.  It was a fun, sexy story that showed how opposites attract.Jordan, the third brother, was the last story.  He's the sexy, calm, vet.  His story was slightly different from the rest.  He meets Georgia, who is a dancer at a bar, divorced, takes care of her mother, and had two children.  Sparks fly right away between them.  Despite Jordan not liking Georgia being a dancer, he never tried to force her to quit and accepted her for who she was and what she had to do to take care of her kids.  I was worried his story was going to be short and he was a great guy so I was glad his story turned out to be complete.  His book was probably my second favorite after Gabe's.Casey, Sawyer son, was also more involved in this story and there's one he's in called Enticing.Overall the series started out a little rocky, but ended up great.  All four brothers have great qualities about them and some flaws.  At times in any of the stories things became predictable.  Also it seemed like every brother fell instantly in love with the woman in their story.  There wasn't a lot of leading up to them realizing they had feelings, it happened right away every time.

One decent, halo-over-his-head glowing, handsome, tall, muscular, sexy, honest, single, well-endowed, straight brother is amazing, two is shocking, three is a stretch, and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny, sweet, and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced, single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls. He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence. Turns out she's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who's out to get her. Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single, large and a temper to match. At least he only pretends to have a temper. His bark is worse than his bite, but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior. Misty, Honey's sister, enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding. Morgan takes an instant dislike to her, a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her. He thinks she's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble. What's more, Misty is broke, unemployed, and pregnant. Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss, then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy. After learning of her situation, Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town's handyman extraordinaire. He meets Lizzy, a redhead he doesn't find particularly attractive at first, when she comes to interview him for a paper she's writing on people who have performed heroic acts. Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother, but she has serious self-confidence issues. This is a true story of opposites attract. Gabe is as laid back as can be, who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself. He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility. Lizzy is as uptight as one can get, freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun, and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice. Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother. Burnt badly by her ex-husband, she doesn't trust men and doesn't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others. Especially Jordan, who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand. Of all the books, this one is the funniest. Jordan's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless. However, of all the books, this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters. Between the romance brewing between Georgia's mother and Misty & Honey's father, and Sawyer's son, I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable. So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male, testosterone laden, treat the women like doormats heroes, it's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive. All the women had spunk which is something I also like. They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories.

Which came too late, she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away? What!? I wanted to slap her. Then the story is like a soap-opera, now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father.

Caleb McCurdy has just been released from a five year stint in a Yuma prison. He'd taken the fall for his outlaw brothers who'd tried to rob the bank and left him holding the horses. He'd paid for his participation, but his soul is tormented by the deeds of his brothers at the Shafton Ranch. Caleb owed a debt to the widow Shafton for the killing of her husband, something he had tried to stop. Laura Shafton remembers that evil day five years before in her nightmares. She'd lost her husband but she had her son, Robbie; the unborn child she'd been carrying. She's wary of strangers, so when Caleb knocks on her door to offer work for food, she greets him with a shotgun. While Caleb is mending her gate, Robbie seems to disappear, only to be found hiding in a tree. On his way down the boy falls breaking his arm, and Caleb helps Laura set the break and splint it. This builds a certain amount of wary trust in Laura and she allows Caleb to stay in her tool shed and continue to work for food. Caleb fears that at any time Laura's going to recognize him as the 17 year old who had accompanied those evil men, but he's matured a lot since then and his body has grown strong. Laura too is no longer the teenage bride; she's now a strong independent woman. Their attraction is something that Caleb fights; for he knows that should Laura ever find out who his is she'll never forgive him.I really liked the plot for this story. The characters are very well developed and easy to like. Though both Laura and Caleb are in their early 20's in this book, they've both lived a life time in experiences. Caleb has always been a good man, but he'd been misguided by his need for family, and so he'd stuck with his brothers. Laura is incredibly strong and resilient, almost over the top so. She'll survive anything in order to protect and care for her son. Though I found myself skipping over paragraphs because the pace seemed slow, this was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "This was a good book, one of forgiveness and healing.", "unixReviewTime": 1329868800, "reviewTime": "02 22, 2012"}

What I disliked about him was that had been with whores. That is just disgusting on so many levels. I get that in romance novels guys aren't suppose to be virgins and women have to be virgins or have been with a least one man, but sleeping with whores takes it to another level. What I did like abut him is that protected Laura and her son, Robbie. Would I recommend his book to anyone? No. Would I read it again? No. It is an okay book to read if you 're bored.

I didn't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago, Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal. Laura Shafton's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her. Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb. The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred, traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later. After being released from prison (being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away), Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch. He passes by wondering if she's okay and what happened to her. When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories. To absolve himself for even being there, he offers to help her around her ranch. She cautiously takes the stranger's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story. Laura is such a strong heroine. You'll cry for all she's lost in family, raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face. How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love. Caleb is a hero you sympathize with. As a half breed (American/Native American), you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb's \"fatherly\" patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall: I'd definitely pick this one up if I were you.

Her newly ex-husband didn't even bother showing up for the final signing. Her controlling, though well-intentioned, sister is ready to remove body parts off the man, but Lucy is feeling more confused than heartbroken. She wants answers for why her husband was making time with a blond bimbo in their house. Over lunch, she tries to explain to her sister that she's okay but ready to take control over her own life...as soon as she gets answers from Bradley for why he did what he did.Across the restaurant, two cops working on an embezzlement case overhear Lucy talking about Bradley and officer Zack Warren realizes that the tip he and his partner got to show up at this dive to nab Bradley the embezzler just went live. He confronts Lucy as she's leaving the restaurant...and then bullets are flying and he's getting beat up by the woman who's life he just saved.Lucy feels nothing but empowered as she realizes she's successfully defended herself against a mugging and takes off after the police show up to grab the wretched scruffy guy in leather who put his hands on her. She feels so empowered, in fact, she decides to dye her hair. Blond was a mistake, so she tries for brunette. Just as she's realizing that the attempted dye job left her hair dead and...well...green...the doorbell rings and the thug she'd beat up is standing there...with his policeman's shield in hand. Oops.Today Lucy got divorced, shot at, manhandled, dyed her hair green, and beat up a cop. She isn't having a good day.What started out as a sort of loony but amusing premise was quickly strained by an anorexic plot that pushed beyond the boundaries of plausibility or credulity and by characters that lacked more than superficial development. Zack is the Peter Pan who equates committed relationships with death and Lucy is the pushover who is so intent on remaking herself she's willfully blind to common sense.Though I prefer more three dimensional characters and found Zack's abrupt about-face on relationships as soon as he spends time with Lucy a bit hard to swallow, I honestly liked him. He's pretty uncomplicated and generally a nice guy - and any male who still wants a woman with ugly green hair is worth something. His character and his reaction to things is where all the humor in this book lays for me. I didn't find him believable, and he's pretty two dimensional, but I did generally enjoy him.What really turned me off this book was Lucy. I found her character to be so irredeemable - between her lack of common sense and worse, lack of intelligence, her absurdly obtuse reactions even after things started blowing up, and her apparent lack of self preservation, I couldn't figure out for the life of me how Zack could even tolerate her, let alone love her. I actually found her distasteful as a character and difficult to read when paired with Zack.Unfortunately, for a book like this to work for me, I have to like both leads. I so disliked Lucy that what would have been a silly and unrealistic but entertaining light romantic comedy, Getting Rid of Bradley, was ruined for me.Strange Bedpersons- 3 StarsOriginally published in 1994, there's little about this quirky romance about the ladder-climbing yuppie Republican lawyer Nick and the hippie, commune-raised, militant-feminist liberal Tess that doesn't feel almost painfully dated. That being said, Crusie pens a fast-paced plot that delves more deeply than I'd anticipated into the potential disaster of a relationship between two people who love each other, but who are so different they will never see eye to eye.Nick, despite his career-loving little heart, is a fun character who is actually pretty forgiving and able to compromise, though he does have a rather vanilla predilection for sex in bed. He's pretty darn forgiving of some pretty radical behavior and recognizes before Tess does that some compromise is in order, yet he still manages to mess up a little as he presses his own sense of fashion off onto the bohemian Tess and tries to wear down some of her rougher edges before he realizes that he's got to decide to accept her as is or lose her. I found Tess harder to like, though I did respect her commitment to her values. Still, her uncompromising attitude and selfish judgments of those who don't share her militant views were off-putting through most of the book.Strange Bedpersons started abruptly, too abruptly, with Nick banging on Tess' door and Tess closing it in his face, the two of them obviously already sharing a history. It took a little while to get the story on their history, so the opening of the book seemed jarring and left me feeling like I missed something. It made it hard to get into and I had to struggle a bit to 'catch up.' That did subside a bit as the story progressed, though the other issues - the dated feeling and my issues with Tess - didn't. Still, I can't argue Crusie's ability to nail witty, fast-moving dialogue and touch on human truisms with humor and intelligence. I just wish that prior to republication, this story had gone through a bit of a brush up to make it more socially and culturally timely and not quite so anachronistic to contemporary romance.What the Lady Wants- 4 StarsMitchell Peatwick Kincaid is a stockbroker, but a fondness for Sam Spade and a mild feeling of discontent with his job convinced him to get a private investigator license, and about a year ago, a bet with his boss and some friends - and a lot of alcohol - goaded him into leaving his prosperous career with his prestigious firm, putting the stuff from his monied life into storage, and taking on private detecting as a career under the name Mitchell Peatwick. And if he can get his private investigation firm into the black in a year, he'll win that $10,000 bet.Twelve months of private investigating, however, taught Mitch two things: everybody lies, and real life private investigation work doesn't resemble anything remotely similar to Sam Spade's life. Until SHE walked in.SHE is Mae Belle Sullivan and she's looking for a PI who isn't all that bright so she can lie to him. Not for kicks, but to get help finding answers following the death of her uncle. Answers that will save Mae from financial ruin and explain what her reprehensible old fart of a relative was doing with all the art and keepsakes that have been disappearing from his house for the past few months. An overheard conversation pointed her in the direction of her uncle's journal, but it's been missing since he died and Mae's starting to get frantic to find it. So she lies. And she uses her feminine wiles. And she pays Mitch Peatwick just about everything in her bank account to investigate the murder of her uncle. Who was in his seventies, had a heart condition and a twenty-five year old mistress, and died in her bed. Mae's fairly certain it wasn't murder.Mitch knows he's being lied to by the delicious-looking Mae Belle, but her retainer pushes him into the black and secures his bet...and anything is better than trailing cheating spouses, so he takes her case. There are just a couple of problems for them both. Mitch isn't anywhere near as slow as Mae had hoped, and as more and more clues start to pile up, her uncle's death starts to look more and more like an actual murder - even to Mae.With a quirky cast of primary and secondary characters and a twisting, rollicking plot that includes suspense, mystery, romance, and comedy, What the Lady Wants delivers a lot of charm and a few good hours of light entertainment. Originally published in 1995, the story is a little worn around the edges and has a bit of a dated patina to it, but not so much that it detracts from the story as in some of Crusie's books. It's more like a faint scent on the air than a bat upside the head. Noticeable, but not painful.Mitch is a fun character, and quicker than he looks. Which is probably a good thing. I'm dating myself here, but he reminded me a lot of Magnum PI or Rick Simon from Simon & Simon - a bit cynical about life, a bit sloppy on the outside but sharp and thorough when he needed to be. Mae was endearing. Intelligent and kind, with a streak of independence a mile wide and a determination that is formidable. She's a bit stubborn when she needs to be, but not so cold as to be unappealing as a person. She cares about the people she loves and takes on the responsibility of caring for them, as needed. Together they made a good couple, and their banter was one of the high points of the book.Crusie excels at quickly paced plots with quirky characters and a lot of witty, intelligent, and sarcastic banter. It's what keeps me coming back to her when I want or need some brain candy. I'd love to see this story get a bit of a modernized polish to clear away the dated patina, but even as it stands, I liked it quite a bit.Charlie All Night- 3.5 StarsWhen you're the go-to girl at the radio station and you're producing the number one drive time show in the area, you've got a lot of responsibility and your future is looking bright. When the talent of that show dumps you, then two months later fires you from the show, you're bright future starts to look more like flames from a crash and burn. Allie McGuffey is feeling the heat from those flames after her radio personality ex-boyfriend Mark dumps her as producer and the station puts her on a new overnight time slot. Pushed from drive time to overnight is humiliating. Pushed there by her ex-boyfriend with his supercilious attitude and delusions of competency is even worse.Putting on a good face just leads to another crisis as a mad dash to the nearest bar/restaurant with her ex hot on her heels forces Allie into uncharted waters. She picks up the first non-suit wearing male she can find and desperately tries to act like she's perfectly okay while her insides are still quaking. Though the rugged man she clings to is obviously surprised by her blatant come on, he doesn't sell her out, which makes him a hero in Allie's book.Charlie Tenniel is a bit of a bounce around. He doesn't stay in one place too long, doesn't limit himself to doing one thing for his life, either. His wanderlust is a constant disappointment for his socially formidable father. His brother, radio personality Ten Tenniel, was more the man his father wanted him to be, but look where that got him - a drug habit and escape from prosecution courtesy of their father's connections. Charlie wasn't going to go out like that. He was, however, going to take the job his father wanted him to take as a favor to the station owner, an old family friend. An anonymous tip claims knowledge of a drug ring opperating from the station and Charlie's been conscripted to chase down the responsible party. He just wants to fly under the radar for the six weeks or so he plans to stay in town, so having Allie pressed up against him is just fine, but when he realizes she's his new producer and intends to make him a star, he's just as adamant that she doesn't.His position would probably be a lot stronger if he could just stay out of her bed.While the premise of Charlie All Night is a bit of a stretch and the actions of Allie and Charlie seem more than a little irresponsible both sexually and professionally, I can't argue that the story itself is light, fun entertainment with plenty of endearing moments. I enjoyed the banter and romantic development between Allie and Charlie. Crusie does banter and endearing really well and it's definitely in evidence here. There's not much to the plot, though, and with an original publication date of 1996, there's a dated feel to both the technology and equipment described in the station and a definite pre-Monica Lewinsky air of sexual permissiveness in the work place that didn't translate well for me.So long as you don't take the book too seriously, or expect much in the way of depth of plot or character, there's still a lot of entertainment to be had from the story of Charlie and Allie, two people who won't be poster children for sexual harassment litigation any time soon, but who still managed to make me chuckle.Originally reviewed by title for One Good Book Deserves Another.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Humor But Little 'Contemporary' Romance", "unixReviewTime": 1283644800, "reviewTime": "09 5, 2010"}

Although the coercion is a small part of the story, and I wouldn't characterize it as hardcore or full-on, it is still there for me to enjoy. Now, I know this idea of coercion doesn't work for everyone, but Abby's seeking to appease Mason with her body was very hot to me.Plus, she really wasn't doing something she didn't want to do. She'd been resisting Mason for weeks, denying him at every turn, and I think this was a convenient reason for her to give in to her attraction to Mason. For his part, he sees this as an opportunity to force her to spend some time with him and to take a chance on him. And how she resisted this man for a month, I just do not know. A military alpha with that commanding presence, muscular body, beautiful brown skin, sexy bedroom eyes, and a total good guy all the way around-- What was the girl thinking?Abby does have her reasons for resisting him, and as she and Mason spend the weekend together, stronger feelings other than lust develop. This story isn't long; it's actually around 58 pages. There is lots of sex, but it's done the way I love sex to be done: super hot, well-written, with the sexy edge of an in-charge man, and with a very sweet emotional connection between h/H.

If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great. Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story. I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format. I want to know what happens. Trust me, I have read short stories that had the perfect plot line that it could be told in a way that the reader was happy at the end. This definitely isn't it.

What have you got? A really great read!I know when I read a K.A. Mitchell book, I'm in for a white hot read. This book lives up to her reputation for sizzling sex and depth of emotion in her characters. I felt like I was right there with the characters and going through the trials and triumphs next to them.I breezed through this book quickly, but don't think it's a light-hearted read. It's got its comical moments, but it's also got tender moments. There were many times when I rooted for the characters to get their heart's desires.Ryan lives a structured but carefree life. He's got his issues and his problems, but he's ordered. I loved when he's in the club - he wasn't about to have a random hook-up. And yet, he does. It's his willingness, even when he's not sure of it, to step out of his comfort space that I liked. There's a very touching moment when he struggles with what he wants from Jeff. I loved that scene, even though it broke my heart.Jeff is hard to understand. He's got a lot going on and a lot to hide. But it's believable. He can't lose his daughter, but he can't seem to let go of Ryan. That sort of conundrum is a good one to have in some ways. Ryan's a hunky catch. Anna, Jeff's daughter, adds a cute and heartwarming touch. She's smitten with Ryan and totally in favor of her daddy being happy. If only all people could be that understanding...If you want a story that's hot and has a sizzling scene in a Camaro (my vehicular weapon of choice), then you need to read Custom Ride.

Or perhaps she was simply fulfilling her destiny?  No matter, she was just determined to save her dying friend, the dragon Reynor, and to do that she must engage the help of his Knight, Sir Kaden, or his love, the dragoness Linea.A waitress in a simple pub, Lucia certainly never expected to return to the tavern with two dragons, two Knights, and the Queen of Draconia herself in tow!  But it is just this troupe of heroes that arrive in time to help Reynor, for it is not just his body that is withering, but his spirit as well.It soon becomes clear to Knights Kaden and Marcus that Lucia is their mate, fated to complete the union between dragons and knights and round out their family.  But Lucia isn't from Draconia, and while she has heard rumor of the strange custom in which two Dragon Knights must marry one woman, she is uncertain she can go through with it...If you have read many of my reviews, it is no secret to you that I am a huge fan of author Bianca D'Arc, and most especially her Dragon Knights stories.  You can imagine my pleasure that she continues to imagine new stories for this fascinating series, and that she seems to have no trouble finding ways to keep the stories fresh and exciting, as proven once more with the newest edition in the saga, Wings of Change.With this new story, we enjoy a return to the m&eacute;nage theme that began the series.  This scenario guarantees some built-in angst for the story as Lucia tries to come to terms with the idea of mating with two men, a situation beyond her experience or the societal norms of her own country.  But Kaden and Marcus are more than up to the task of convincing her that their love is true and right, with a little help from Marcus' dragoness, the Lady Linea.Of course, the relationship between these three isn't the sole focus of D'arc's book - she fleshes it out nicely with some long-hidden secrets about Lucia, some of which she herself is hiding, and a few of which have been long hidden from her.  As we learn Lucia's secrets, we see that she may very well be a most important figure in the future of the war between Draconia and Sskithdron.The author introduces us to yet another most intriguing new species, something I believe I'm becoming rather spoiled on!  As a long-time lover of Fantasy stories, my excitement with the introduction of each new creature builds more and more, expanding not only the horizons within this world, but my interest as well.Wings of Change is the fifth story in the Dragon Knights series, and will be released in print in the future anthology, I Dream of Dragons I.  While this book can be read as a standalone without leaving the reader confused, the story will be best enjoyed if you read the entire series in order.

Someone plans to harm her favorite horse, and Maris is hit in the head.  She wakes up in a motel room the next day with a concussion.  Mac is with her.  He was recently hired to work with her on the horse farm.  Together they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about it.  Maris has no memory of what she was doing before she was injured.  Maris realizes she is attracted to Mac.REVIEWER'S OPINION:This was about half the length of a typical romance novel.  It was a \"falling in lust\" story.  There was no time for any relationship development.  It was shallow.  I wanted more intrique, unique characters, and more interesting plot and dialogue.  But if you loved the series, you might like this out of curiosity.After the mystery and danger is over, a chunk of time is spent with Maris' family in Wyoming.  There is the cute little toddler, all the hunky men, their wives and children.  Everyone is loving and protective.  It was a pleasant time.OTHER BOOKS:There are five Mackenzie books.  The first three were much better than books 4 and 5.  This is book 4.  For a list of my reviews of all five books, see my 5 star review of Burn posted 7-11-09.CAUTION SPOILER:I didn't understand the scene in which Maris was hit in the head (which was told and not shown).  Apparently the bad guy was starting to inject the horse when Maris arrived.  He hits her in the head causing a concussion, but she is able to get on the horse and ride away.  Can one be concussed and still mount and ride?  Why couldn't the bad guy finish the injection as she was mounting?  I wanted more details and showing, not telling.DATA:Kindle count story length: 1462.  Swearing language: mild.  Sexual language: mild.  Number of sex scenes: 1, about a page long.

What he finds is a ruthless pack Alpha who is abusing his Omega, a werewolf named Laine, and terrorizing the rest of the pack. One thing about werewolves.... they recognize their mate instantly, that special person that Fate has chosen for him, and the omega Laine is Devlin's mate. He quickly claims Laine as his, and now must work to dispatch the Alpha and remove him from his post so the town can be in peace again and he and his Laine can live happily ever after.The erotic nature is wonderfully sexy, it's romantic, it's funny, it's witty, and it's all-around good fun. The pace is swift, though the danger presented within the pages seems to be dispelled too easily to make for any real suspense. Still, it's a totally fun and engrossing story.I heartily recommend it, and especially recommend \"Without Reservations\" and \"With Caution\" (in that order), two more stories set in the same universe (the characters in this book have been mentioned in Without Reservations). While I enjoy the other two books more, this is still a wonderful and entertaining tale.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A great take on werewolf/shifter love and romance", "unixReviewTime": 1276214400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2010"}

It made for a good attention grabber.  Now while I don't mind that feeling when it comes to a plot line in general, I'm not so keen on it when it comes to the romance side of the plot so I read this one with mixed feelings in the beginning.  Glad I gave it a chance.  It still wouldn't be my favorite romance plot, but it turned out to be a fun story.Dev drives out to a predetermined meeting place to meet the alpha of the pack in the area he plans on relocating too.  Just as he arrives, he witness the alpha and his betas punish the pack omega.  They are holding him down getting ready for a rape and Dev rescues the smaller man.When Dev gets the guy away, he discovers that the handsome man is his mate.  Laine and Dev accept the circumstances quickly.  Laine fills in the situation of what is going on with the bully alpha to Dev and Dev realizes that he will have to take the guy on if he wants to stay in the area.Dev is part-owner in a construction company and his friends and part-owner join him.  The alpha steps up his aggression towards Laine forcing Dev's hand.  But even though that Laine is rather a klutz, he wants to help Dev take on the alpha and his betas.It is a novella length story so the plot jumps in and gets going quickly.  The shifter world described here includes the idea that when the wolves find their mate, there is a bond made.  Sometimes I don't mind this, but it happened before I had a chance to really get to know the characters so I wasn't sold on this relationship until late in the story.  These two went at it hot and heavy before they barely got past learning each other's first names.  Now don't get me wrong, I learned to like both characters once I got to know them and I liked them together.  Laine's klutziness and his sweet temperament were cute and Dev's patience and gentleness with Laine was nice.  It was not hard picturing Dev as a pack alpha just because of the two sides to his personality.  He liked to be in charge, but he was also very protective.  And that reminds me of another thing about this particular shifter world, I liked the idea of the different designations for those involved in the pack.  We are all familiar with alphas, and get the idea of betas who are the alpha's lieutenants, but I thought the inclusion of the lesser used omega or peacemaking wolf role was pretty cool.It was a light quick read that I can recommend to those who enjoy PNR that is more on the passionate side and isn't very dark.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Quick Fun Read That Jumps Right in With the Plot and Romance", "unixReviewTime": 1352419200, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2012"}

The story opens with a couple who has been married for six years.  The wife suspects her husband of keeping a mistress after she finds a diamond bracelet in their drawers and then later finds out that she was not the recipient of said bracelet when bracelet disappears. He picked up the bracelet for his brother unbeknownst to his wife, so the misunderstanding begins.Armed with her suspicions, the wife feels she needs to shake up their marriage and win her husband back from the arms of the phantom mistress. The books begins when she announces over breakfast that she wants to take on a lover. Her husband is reading the paper and not paying attention to the conversation, agrees with everything she says.  She feels that after six years of marriage and two children, their marriage has become dull and is concern that her husband has or will look for a mistress to spice things up.The two still love each other very much, but marriage for them has become somewhat a rut after six years.  So what does this couple do? They go through the charade of finding her a lover. He tells her he wants to help select her lover. She agrees and then blackmails his twin brother to pretend to be her lover and pursue her anonymously. Her husband also seeks help from his brother to play the role of the lover and pursue her (but not bed her), so she does not have the time to seek another lover. Neither is aware that the brother is the only one privy to the dual roles he is playing.In the end, the husband realizes that he had been taking his wife for granted and has not lived up to his promises of giving her the adventure he spoke of during their courtship. He also admits to his brother and himself of recently developing a wondering eye and possessing a feeling of restlesstness  He knows that he has been neglecting her and not telling her how much he loved her and that he was the one  responsible for allowing their marriage to fall into a rut. He then likens his comfortable marriage to an untended garden. That was a good analogy.I thought this was a sweet story, but felt it could have been longer with more detailed flashbacks regarding their courtship. I only caught glimpses of the wonderment that she wanted to recapture from the days of their courtship. I like stories with married couples who are not fighting. One sticking issue with me is the reference of the wandering eye. If you are as in love with your wife as you claim to be - should you have a wandering eye?

Putting a book as a freebie draws in those with no interest in the genre.All that said, the demon tale is one I would choose to read from a favorite author, as I am a fan of horror and supernatural fiction, so I reserve the right to be a tad critical. The set up of the story (the pre-prologue, if you like) was great. It tells the history of the demons, how they came to be. It was well written, interesting & gave me hope that it would be a great book.  As another reviewer stated though, the actual prologue was rather cliche-ridden with Gage and his \"lethal charm\" and Jordan resisting at every turn until she melted into his kisses. But I pushed on....As we know from the pre-prologue, Shadow Demons roam the earth. They are evil, they feed on emotion. Jordan, our heroine, is a vigilante destroyer: cop by day, demon slayer by night, after she witnessed the brutal murder of her partner and lover at the sword of a Shadow Demon.The storyline itself isn't bad, but it does lack development of the characters. Other than Jordan being stubborn and feisty, there's not much else that we learn about her. The twist in the tale isn't shocking - not because I expected it (I didn't at all) but because we didn't get to know enough about any of the other characters to really care, and so when the twist was revealed, it gave me more of a \"oh\" reaction than a \"WOW! I never would have guessed\" shocker.My title calls this repetitive, and it does become so. The same fight scenes replay, but worse - the same sex scene is basically repeated over and over. I think even those readers who love a racy sex scene would be disappointed. By the 3rd replay, I skipped them altogether.

Chapter demarcations make it so much easier to see how far along a person is in a book and how close a person is to the end of a chapter when he/she needs to find a stopping place at times.

Dionne \"Chrissy Dionne\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "Eastern Texas, 1879At the age of five, Emma Radcliff made the monumental announcement that she is going to marry Rafe Sinclair.  She's done a lot of growing up in the fifteen years since then and has decided that she's not going to marry at all.  Wearing breeches and working horses on her father's ranch suits her just fine.  Only her plans are thwarted when her father insists that she marry Rafe - no if's, and's, or but's.Rafe Sinclair really has no interest in getting married but a stipulation in his grandfather's will forces the issue.  He has to be married by the time he turns thirty or he loses the Circle S Ranch.  Since he's known Emma her entire life she seems like a relatively safe choice but the last thing he anticipates is the little hellcat's insistence that he agree to stay out of her bed.  To make matters worse, little Emma is looking mighty gown up and he's just discovered that he wants her - in every way.Since Emma insists on her no sex clause, Rafe counters her with a clause of his own - that she reserves the right to change her mind and void her clause at any time.  Though still not entirely comfortable with the situation Emma agrees but also requests that she be allowed to work with the horses at the Triple R. They'll both have what they want - well almost.  Things don't go exactly according to plan.  Emma's father refuses to allow her to return to work the horses after the marriage takes place, she counterattacks with the insistence that she takes some of the horses with her.Rafe and Emma marry but no sooner are the vows spoken then the trouble starts.  Emma's always been very attracted to Rafe and Rafe is definitely finding it difficult to adhere to her `no marital privileges' clause.  What's a guy to do when he discovers that is new wife is the sexiest thing on two legs?  Well being a man of his word, he can't just grab her up and take her to his bed, he's going to have to seduce her.  Only Emma's just as stubborn as he is persuasive.  Which one will hold out the longest?Beth Williamson presents readers with yet another wonderful historical tale with her contribution to the LEATHER AND LACE series - BRANDED.  Emma won me over from the very first page.  She's so `in-your-face' and not afraid to go against convention that I couldn't wait to read all about her and find out how or even if Rafe can `tame' her.  Rafe grew up knowing Emma so of course he's never seen her in any sort of sexual way but he's seeing her now and practically salivating just thinking about bedding his own wife.  Ms. Williamson even throws in several supporting characters that you'll love to hate or hate to love, but in either case they're definitely unique and fun.Be sure to keep an eye out for the other LEATHER AND LACE series books.

She knows that deep down a man life Rafe could never love a woman like her so she sets out to negotiate her own marriage terms.Rafe Sinclair can't believe his grandfather put a stipulation to his inheritance.  If he doesn't marry by his birthday, the ranch on which he lives will no longer be his.  Having no choice but to find a wife, Rafe doesn't look forward to the politics that go along with wife hunting.  However, his problem is solved when Emma Radcliff's father and he agree on his marrying Emma.  Now if he can just get Emma to agree, his inheritance will be safe and Rafe will have a wife.Emma and Rafe have to learn to be a team.

The heroine takes things for granted and should have talked to the hero when his assistant told her they were sleeping together, but she had insecurities that all pregnant women have and thought he wanted someone else. They were faithful during their time apart, which is always a plus to me. My favorite part is when she told him about how she had been proposed to before and that the waiter was going to propose tonight (to his own g/f, but she leaves that out to the hero) and he gets up and leaves, doesn't say anything, and comes back 30 minutes later with a ring.

She could smell his skin, a scent of soap and hot desert sun and something more - something she couldn't describe but made her yearn for him with all the ferocity of her heart, as she'd once hungered for Christmas as a child.

This time it's Ross Benson's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy, titled, and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails.  He's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents.  The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country.  She detests crowds, couldn't care less about fashions, and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet.  She's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books.  The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly weren't meant for a lady to hear.  The men are obviously inebriated but she doesn't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse.  When she opens the door to check on them, Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him.  They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he can't remember which guest room is his.  Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he doesn't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt.  From a maidenly point of view, that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake.  As she's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed, Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she can't deny him the request and soon doesn't want to deny him or the pleasures that they'll both find in his bed.  Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment?IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.  This storyline is full of all the loveable characters, passion and suspense that I've come to eagerly anticipate about this series.  I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies.  She's extremely intelligent and honest, not to mention beautiful.  With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her.  Ross has been living the `privileged' lifestyle for so long he doesn't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra. There's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit, I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so won't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "the third book in Emma Wildes' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB.", "unixReviewTime": 1213142400, "reviewTime": "06 11, 2008"}

Cassandra has always had a big crush on her brother's best friend nobleman Ross Benson.  Cassandra is young only nineteen and she is a bluestocking enjoying country pursuits much more than London gaiety.Ross and his friend are drunk and when Cassandra helps him to his room he engages in some romantic kisses that end up with the two in bed.  Ross does the honorable deed of course and offers for her and Cassandra agrees to the wedding.  She is astute enough to realize she could be pregnant.What follows mostly in this short story is their adjustment to married life.  Ross simply loves London and his wife does not.  Ross genuinely likes Cassandra but his feelings are not fully engaged until later.  I liked Ross because he did not take himself too seriously and he had a teasing but kind sense of humor.I cannot say the same about Cassandra who was tart, somewhat priggish (surprising for a woman whose first intimacies are outside marriage) and she just did not respond well to Ross's sweet teasing and innuendo.  He was a dynamic interesting person while Cassandra comes off as humorless and interested more in her books than her surroundings.  She never was as charismatic as her lead which leaves this book with a three star rating.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Liked the hero more than the heroine", "unixReviewTime": 1316995200, "reviewTime": "09 26, 2011"}

He is a jaded rake of a man, and the object of many women's fantasies.  He and Timothy Rollins are arriving back at Ivydale Manor, drunk, when they wake young Cassandra, Timothy's sister, who helps both men to bed.  When she ends up in bed with Ross, her lifetime crush, it will have repercussions none of them counted on.Ross is handsome, sought after and has never had an inclination toward innocent young women.  For some unfathomable reason, Cassandra tempts him like no woman has before.  When he seduces her on a night of drunken stupor, he has no choice but to marry the alluring Cassandra.In a Reckless Moment is a charming story of opposites attracting.  Ross and Cassandra burn up the pages as their explosive chemistry is the foundation for building a marriage from convenience to a forever love.  Cassandra is a woman many will appreciate for her independence, her common sense and her genuine love for Ross and her family.  She is warm and witty, charming and beautiful.  With not a vain bone in her body, she endeared herself to me even further.  Ross, on the other hand, is a charming and handsome rogue; he is jaded and spoiled until Cassandra brings him down a few pegs.  He is clueless about love and it is with baited breath that this reader watched as he fell further under Cassandra's spell each day.  With the underlying mystery of Ross's past to keep this reader guessing, I was intrigued by the storyline, both the journey to falling in love and the mystery of threats to the couple's safety.

The opening scene is this h enjoying a dip in a river while unbeknownst to her, Devon, our H, is watching her lustfully from the trees.  The H is the son of her husband.  He was raised by his aunts after his mother died and the Father felt  unprepared to raise him by himself. Devon is later kidnapped and raised by a band of lawless men.  Devon is tough, dominant and ...yes...gorgeous .....and huge...in every way.....hence.....the cannon references.

Original, epic, and enthralling, I was unable to put it down and am chomping at the bit to read the next four books in the collection. A true master of the sci/fi adventure genre on par with Vance and Wells......\"The Gods of Mars\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The hectic, chaotic, frenetic, pace continues as John Carter, his son Carthoris, and Tars Tarkas take on the Issus and the \"the blacks\" to rescue Dejah Thoris (Princess of Helium). Massive battles and unrelenting treachery and deceit continues to fuel the fusilade of destruction on the enemy air fleets. Pulp sci/fi adventure at its best makes this one of the most entertaining stories of all time from the pen of a master storyteller......\"The Warlord of Mars\" saga and action continues unabated in the third book in the Barsoom Series and it's fantastic! Almost constant conflict confronts John Carter, Prince of Helium, as he fights for the release of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The budding love between their son Carthoris and Thuvia of Ptarth brings joy to both houses. Edge of your seat battles against the Lord of the Thenes, Matai Shang, and his minion Thurid will keep you awake at nights as the Jed's come together and unite under the Jedakk of Jedakaks, the Warlord of Barsoom!......\"Thuvia, Maid of Mars\"carries on and expands this epic collection of stories. Book IV of the series shifts the focus away from John Carter to his son Carthoris and Thuvia, the love of his life. Enduring many hardships and death defying battles and contraptions Carthoris rescues Thuvia and receives the blessing from Kulan Tith, her designated husband, to marry her in his stead. Although a bit repetitive with events/confrontations similar to the previous books this is never-the-less a thrilling roller coaster ride that will exhilarate and enthrall you throughout...onward to the V and final book in the collection......\"The Chessmen of Mars\" is my least favorite book in \"The Barsoom Series.\" I loved the pacing and one of the most original and imaginative creature/humanoid/ creations in all of science fiction \"Ghek the Kaldane from Bantoom.\" Kaldane's are unquestionably one of the most unusual, unique, creepy, entertaining yet unsettling, beings ever conjured by an inditer in the sci/fi genre...a simply wonderful and amazing creature! Once again the story shifts from Carthoris and Thuvia to the new heroine \"Tara, Princess of Helium\" and her suitor \"\"Gahan, Jeddak of Gatholian.\" I love this series in spite of its predictability and occasional redundancy.

In fact, I normally don't read this genre. So why did I download THE ADVENTURES of \"John Carter on Mars\" - THE ORIGINAL FIVE STORIES? I'm not sure. Maybe because I had been reading H. Rider Haggard's \"Allan Quatermain\" series and saw a similarity between the stories about AQ and JC. Both are chock-full of adventure and nonstop action; take place in exotic locations: Africa and Mars; and both are easy to read while I jog on my treadmill. There are probably other reasons, but maybe they're of a subconscious nature.The storyline of \"A Princess of Mars\" (The first book in the series.) has already been mentioned, so I won't say too much more about it. Generally, though, it's a story about creatures who are always at war, the green Martians (ugly, very tall and unemotional) vs the red Martians (attractive, human-like and full of emotion).There is a lot of warring going on on the planet Barsoom/Mars with green Martians against red Martians and greens against other greens and reds battling other reds. Who, then, comes between them all and is captured at one time or another by both sides, wins some of their green and red hearts, is betrayed by green and red, imprisoned here and there, and ultimately...? None other than earth man John Carter, ex-captain in the CSA during the American Civil War, and unwitting traveler to this strange world. There is also a love story sandwiched in between the action and adventure segments. John Carter falls in love with the beautiful princess Dejah Thoris (red Martian) who is the reason for all of the above mentioned conflict.If you can really suspend disbelief and remember that this was written in 1911, then you will thoroughly enjoy reading this series. 4 Stars", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Tales of Adventure and Planetary Love", "unixReviewTime": 1335052800, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2012"}

He's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates.  His father refused and Dylan's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful.  He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire.  His has very little funds, is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he's staying and his father's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry, Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman.  She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they're all far more interested in her monetary value then her.  Besides, she's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless.  There's only one man who appeals to her, Captain Dylan Blake, but he's a second son and doesn't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father's all-important annual ball.  Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late.  While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan's audacity, Natalia is intrigued.  She's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake.  Once there, Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan's choosing.  The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish.  The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he's never had any trouble charming any woman, Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he's become.  There's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down.  Dylan's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who's too smart to accept any less than all of him.  Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia's story.  Dylan's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much.  Natalia is impossible not to like - she's smart, beautiful and not at all pretentious.

She doesn't shy away from hurtful emotions in her stories, which I absolutely love about her books. She makes you believe that these people could exist in the real world--in fact I believe I know a few of them.As the daughter of a duke, Natalia knows that she must someday do her duty and marry where her father commands. However, this has not stopped her from dreaming about a war hero who seems to be nothing like the men of society--who only see her large dowry when they look at her. She has built up the reputation as a cold lady who follows her own strict rule of not allowing two dances to the same gentleman at a ball. In reality, she doesn't wish to encourage any man who she knows will not meet with her father's approval. Dylan is the unloved, unwanted second son of an earl. Having sold his commission, he is down on funds and sees no harm in participating in a silly wager--get a cold fish of a girl to dance with him twice. Only the girl is warm and kind and seems to see through him like no one else ever cared to.

Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell? Are they behind the legends of the vampire?

Each member of the clan has an important role to play, vital to their survival, yet, we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant, they are what and who they are, able to see the big picture in the battle for survival, fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions. When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours, it is to survive. Humans are unknown demons to them, weak, yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws. If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family, how to feel loved, or how to find self-respect.

I was both thrilled with the contents and impressed by this author's ability to transport his reader to another world and make you forget yourself while reading his work. This story is amazing. Steve Peek has a unique talent for building believable characters that you can't help but identify with. This story is very complex and has a lot of elements that I had not seen before, and was not at all what I had expected.If you like books that will keep you at the edge of your seat for the entire experience, this is the book to choose. I was particularly fascinated with the way his characters reacted to things. The suspense he manages to build through their uncertainty and terror leaves you half afraid to turn the page, but half afraid not to. This is the type of book that could be adapted into a very exciting movie. The author's descriptions are detailed and bring the book to life before your eyes as though you are watching a film. Here is an example of his descriptive writing:\"The house looked as if it had never seen a coat of paint. The gray planks warped and strained against the rusty nails, which bled dark-red streaks from years of rain.\" Rather than telling the reader everything that is going to happen step by step, Steve Peek allows us to connect the dots and reveals his story through the actions of his characters.There was no extra fluff or poorly utilized space in this novel.By the time you reach the middle of this book, the pages turn furiously. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next, but at the same time I hated to see this book be over with.

I don't have a solution to make it better; I just know that I didn't really get it.The introduction to the 'world' took a long time. Almost a third of the book! It held useful information, but it felt like I was being introduced to characters, ideas and concepts just to have them ripped away. You don't meet the real protagonist until about 30% in either. That meant you only had 70% of the book left in which to get to know them and feel something for them.It took a while, but eventually I did start to care for a couple of the characters. I think the kicker for me though, the turning point in my feelings for the book, revolved solely around the dog. I felt more for that wiry-haired pooch than any of the other characters. That could be because I'm an animal person, but I don't think so. In fact I believe it's got more to do with the characterisation that the dog had that the other characters were lacking.The antagonists were brilliant creations of horrific proportions, but strangely humanesque in some of their actions, protecting their young and mates for example, and so completely alien in other aspects.I didn't really appreciate the dialogue around them and their existence in their world; I think it would have been enough knowing that they came from a hellish world without all the rest of it too.The thing that kept me engaged and enjoying this story was the science/history behind the different worlds. The ley lines and the Indian culture, the standing stones and the magic that was obviously so thoroughly researched by Steve. That part of the story was steeped in so much truth that even though it was completely 'out there' I found myself wanting to believe it too.I didn't much like how things ended, but then I can't say I didn't expect it a little anyway. Steve seemed to enjoy mutilating characters, finding creative ways to dispatch them from the story and well, I guess I came to expect that any characters were potential targets, even those who deserved a second chance at things or ones who were young and innocent.This book is certainly not for the feint-hearted. It starts off slowly enough, but by the end of it you'll be wading through so much blood and guts it all just starts to blur together.This book could do with another pass over by an editor.

The tale unfolds with so much mystery, sections of the story delivered one chunk at a time, that you're held captive to its pages simply out of a desire to find out why something happened in a previous chapter. It's one of those books that keeps you saying, \"Okay, just one more page and then I'll mow the lawn.\" And you keep saying it over and over until you're at the last page, not knowing how you got there so quickly.Mr. Peek tells the story from many perspectives, jumping around from character to character, revealing the bigger picture in stages. Normally, for me, this is a writing style that puts me off; I like to bond with my main character, and I don't like it when the narrative runs off to follow someone else. But with Long Claws, although there is a main character, the other characters that are touched upon are just as unique and interesting. With each turn of the tale, I was surprised to feel a little disappointed that I had to take leave of the character I'd just been following - that's a good thing. It means I was fully invested in each and every one of them, a strong testament to the author's skill.And here is the most amazing part: some of the characters followed are insects, some are werewolves (sort of), some are regular people, and others are people with special powers of awareness. Yes - insects. Steve Peek takes you into the minds and inner workings of a species of insects he's created. And he does it well.This story is epic. The majority of it spans the course of a fifty(ish) year period, but its roots go back tens of thousands of years. Modern mysteries and legends are woven into the fabric of new legends that are the foundation of this story.This isn't a story that begins with a bang.

An ancient Indian tribe knowing about the dangerous otherworldly beasts and closing the energy lines leading to their world. A teenage runaway boy ending up with his old great-uncle who lives to protect humanity by guarding the portal.Then one longclaw discovers a way to cross the border into paradise: our human world, where they are superior predators among easy prey. A brutal fight for survival begins - on both sides.The author uses different time lines, parallel worlds and different points of view, sometimes retelling a scene as experienced from both humans and longclaws. Where other books get lost in their overwhelming, confusing complexity, that is never the case with longclaws, where all parts converge into a coherent and unique whole.The underlying premise that our folklore especially about vampires and werewolves stems from encounters with creatures from another dimension mark Longclaws as an outstanding work in the 'fangs&claws;' genre.

I was very wrong.Instead, with Longclaws, I was immediately swept into some darkly fabulous storytelling.  Instead of struggling to finish the book, I was thinking about the book when doing other things, anxious to return to my reading.Now, to be honest, there were a couple of minor technical issues.  Block paragraphs instead of indentations.  Occasional odd formatting glitches like errant commas inside of words.  And some transitions that weren't noted with extra paragraph spacing.  But I score very hard on formatting and I have to say that the errors were very minor.  The author's storytelling was on point and sharp enough that the formatting only bothered me a little.What stood out for me most in this book is the attention to detail paid to the monsters.  Usually, in monster horror, the monster is pretty one-dimensional.  Monsters fall into very few categories.  Critter gets revenge by killing and eating.  Critter just kills and eats for not much reason at all.  Critter gets a hold of something radioactive and kills and eats.  You know the drill.However, in Longclaws, the author has not only built an entire history and social structure for his critters, he skillfully weaves it into stories of human history and mythology.  As you read, you find that you are delighted as your mind starts making certain connections into our shared history.Peek brings you into the minds of his monsters and, the funny thing is, you start to wonder who the real monsters are.  You start, little by little, to feel for them in their world of predator vs. prey.From reading a bit about the author, it seems like this might have been one of those books written long ago, lingering in a dusty drawer (or computer file), that he brought out, dusted off, and decided to put it out there for publication.

A few Peculiar inhabitants begin experiencing strange dreams and visions.  Animals begin acting wildly.  The lives of several Peculiar residents are linked together in this suspenseful, science fiction novel.I enjoyed this novel because it was suspenseful in parts, had well developed characters and was very well written.For the most part, the book was suspenseful and a page turner.  I had to get to the next page, chapter and definitely had to find out how it all ended!  However, there were some scenes that I felt were too long or drawn out.  This took away from some of the scenes.  I especially felt this way near the end of the book where I think it was filled with too much description.  I felt it was slower-paced with lots of explanation that was not necessary.  That being said, I want to reiterate that there was good suspense and at no point did I want to stop reading or skip to the end.I felt the book was a bit gory.  I expected a science fiction novel but this was a hybrid - mostly science fiction with a few pages of gore.  I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing and I wouldn't take off any stars, but it's just good for a reader to know.

I felt connected to all of them and I could empathize with them.  I cared about what happened to them and wanted to see how the story turned out for each and every one of them.  I enjoyed being on an adventure with these characters.  I'd go on another one with them.  I think I would have liked to see Gordon more developed but maybe that was the point - he was supposed to be a bit mysterious.  I enjoyed (for the most part) the character of Rollins.  He was a bit uneven but I liked that.  I liked how the point of view changed.  It wasn't hard to follow and the reader gets to experience the storylines of the different characters.There was a lot of science in the book.  I have no idea if it was accurate or not but there was a lot of scientific description that was way over my head.

In \"Andromeda Strain,\" the action takes place primarily at a remote laboratory where scientists study the alien organism that has infected and killed most of a small town's population. In \"Peculiar, MO,\" the action is in the town itself and centers around the organism's effects on the local people and a biological terrorism military unit that is studying the alien organism and trying to limit its spread. The tension grows steadily as the unit's scientist comes to the terrifying realization that the organism is attempting to invade the earth, not just infect it.The author's scientific explanation of the mechanism by which the alien plasmids (short strands of DNA) could use earth's plants and animals, including humans, to regenerate the alien species and rebuild its group consciousness and memory is quite detailed. I don't remotely have enough science background to know how plausible this is, but it was a fascinating concept that was more credible than the typical aliens-invade-human-bodies stories. I'll give the author a lot of credit for originality.The author builds the story around several characters. The principal characters, including Kelly Ross, Spencer Dale, and the mysterious John Gordon, are likable, well developed three-dimensional characters. There are some bad guys too, and the author kills them off in some very satisfying (i.e., gruesome) ways.As another reviewer noted, the military unit involved in the story was very small and was led by a non-commissioned officer, with privates doing most of the work. This wasn't very realistic, since the government had already dealt with a previous meteor strike that contained the alien plasmids, so the potential danger was recognized. I'm guessing that the author's reasoning was that a larger unit, such as a battalion, would have brought too much attention from the local people. In any case, this is a fairly minor quibble.Having read other stories by Robert Williams, I expected the writing to be of professional quality, and it was. The story flowed smoothly from scene to scene, and the characters' dialog was realistic. The story grabbed me from the beginning, and the action is pretty much nonstop, ending in an extremely tense and violent climax. Blended smoothly into the action is the relationship between Kelly and Spencer and the blossoming romance that brings them closer together.Editing was generally good, but there were a number of typos in my Kindle version. There weren't enough mistakes to affect my enjoyment of the book, but the author should have proofread his final manuscript more closely.No spoilers here, but after reading \"Peculiar, MO,\" I don't know if I'll ever turn my back on a cat again!The bottom line: This is a first rate page-turner for science fiction and techno-thriller fans.

Warning: the scenes with the cats are not for the squeamish.The writing and descriptions were well-done and there was plenty of conflict. Though some of the characters expressed insights that helped to give them depth, I didn't feel a real connection with them. This may have been because there were so many characters involved. Still, I would like to have had a better feel for the main characters, particularly Gordon.Action scenes were long and drawn out, which slowed the pace more than I would have liked.

When I got this kindle book from Amazon, I really expected little. What I did get was a book that slowly captured my interest and pulled me into its pages. Before I got the e-book, I worried a bit about the plot line as it sounded just like another of the Dan Brown \"wanna-bes\"; however, the \"Secret of the Scroll\" by Chester D. Campbell delivers on all levels and is a wonderful read and a thriller that is hard to put down.Retired Air Force OSI Agent Greg McKenzie and his wife Jill are on a trip to the Holy Land. Shortly before they return home, a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase a \"souvenir\" that turns out to be an ancient scroll. When they innocently return home, the McKenzie's world turns upside down as Jill is taken hostage in a battle between militant Palestinians and radical Israelis to recover this ancient scroll. The police, however, target Greg as a suspect in his wife's disappearance, and with a little help from his friends (and a few others), he sets out alone in a perilous chase to save his wife as she is spirited out of America and back to Israel.The \"Secret of the Scroll\" is honestly a classic page-turner; I often kept reading when I knew I should go to sleep. I just kept saying; \"Just one more chapter.\"  It is a thriller without a large body count; it is a book about an historical artifact without trying to clone Dan Brown.  Yes, there is plenty of action and intrigue, but the real suspense comes from all of McKenzie's efforts to save his wife while trying to stay a step ahead of the mysterious figures who will stop at nothing to get the scroll. While there are many twists and turns in store for the reader, there is as well a strong realism in the characterization of the main character who seems to be a bit more like your neighbor rather than a James Bond super-hero type.

The icing represents our surface only existence. Only Shamans can break free to explore all the inner layers.  In the end we are encouraged to take the plunge into knowledge and awaken humanity to the fullness of existence.This book was a confusing book, (and probably also Atwood&#8217;s Surfacing book, which I did not read) which explains/applies the brilliant concepts which are clearly detailed in Joseph Campbell&#8217;s book, Hero of a Thousand Faces.

K.A. Mitchell. I know when I open a K.A. Mitchell story, I'm sure to squirm in my seat and root for the HEA. This book was no exception. The story flowed effortlessly from page to page, reeling me in and not letting up until the end. In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin. To me, an emotional attachment is the mark of a great story. This one fit the bill.Cade is a piece of pierced work. He's not about to conform to any standards except the lack of standards. His need to be his own man was endearing. What I loved about him was his fallibility. He's been through a bad relationship and bears the scars, but he's still breathing, still going about his life. I had to hand it to him. Many people would crack, especially after the circumstances he'd lived with, but he didn't.Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.I can't leave out the love scenes. Ms. Mitchell writes carefully constructed love scenes that never fail to warrant a chilled drink and the need to hunt down that special person. I felt the love and lust between Cade and Elliot when even they weren't sure the experience was more than just sex. The scene in the backseat of \"Bucky\" the Plymouth had me reading and rereading just to savor the experience.If you want a book that's sure to make you blush for the best reasons, you need to read Hot Ticket.

Cade is Elliott's first (beyond BJ's) and things are going well until Cade runs into his ex at the concert they found the tickets for and he freaks and tries to give Elliott the brush off. Something I thought was interesting which is not usually touched on was that Cade's ex had been having unsafe sex and he'd been tested but had to wait until his 6 month test came back clean. I always understood that you needed that 6 month window but I know in most books once they get that first test that they are clean everything is bareback city.

This place is very much a character in the story, itself.  It's vampire and human friendly, a place for them to meet and mingle, and sometimes even more.  Drink blood, or \"dirty wine\", or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy.  It's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways, loud music, and great ambiance.In the club, Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo.  Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit.  Um, hello, what about Brett??  So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share, I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett's apprehension.But that Lisa, she's a smarty.  And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her, I felt betrayed for Brett, and in a very bad way.  I called Lisa some very bad names.  But like I said, she's smart.  Don't underestimate that girl, and don't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo?  He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books.  I absolutely adore this man, and his lack of inhibitions. He's tall, dark, and handsome.  Sexy and mysterious.  Dangerous.  All of the above, and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m.  And it was so wonderful and beautiful, and unbearably hot.  I definitely recommend it, and I definitely recommend reading it first, before moving on any more in the On The Edge series.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sexy and Hot, and all things Wonderful!", "unixReviewTime": 1368921600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2013"}

It's success was so great that it's owner Brett had to hire more help. After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home. Instead he found himself in whole different, but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this. Number one, the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver. It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress!

Discovering she's female, Asher refuses to fight her, because, even when beseiged by pirates, a gentleman never harms a lady.  Emerald repays him by knocking him overboard and out of harm's way, not knowing this will make Asher the pirates' captive. It eventually loses him the use of his right hand and his brother his sight. Asher escapes and returns to wipe out the stronghold and kill her father and this is where the story begins. Emerald follows him to England. It isn't for revenge but to retrieve her father's walking stick he took because inside it is the map to a treasure she can use to pay off Beau Sandford's debts and free herself from the past.Using her father's family name and right to a title, Emerald becomes Lady Emma Seaton. Naturally Asher's suspicious of her and intrigued because of her obvious lies and uneasiness in high society. Of course they fall in love but this is more an in-depth study of the main characters attitudes than a mere will-they/won't-they love story. Asher is bound by duty and honor...and extreme guilt. His wife died while he was seeking his revenge, his brother was blinded during his rescue. He returns to his family home a widower, disabled in body, but more disabled in spirit, blaming himself for the tragedies occurring during his own travail. Emerald meanwhile sees herself as the cause. If she hadn't knocked him overboard, none of this would've happened.  Still pursuing her hunt for the walking stick, she believes the only way she can repay Asher for the misery she  has caused is to become his mistress and give him back  the love he lost and remove his grief over his brother's condition.It's an interesting story and an entertaining one, sensuous in spots, but staying away from the ballrooms and usual locales for such tales with most of the action taking place at Asher's estate. Flashbacks give reasons for everything that happens instead of playing them out in detail. Though this is the only James' novel I've read, I got the feeling there may be more on this family because of various hints given.

{"reviewerID": "AV64Y0L3C45UX", "asin": "B0014YB7LM", "reviewerName": "James Blakley", "helpful": [11, 15], "reviewText": "When deciding whether or not to give this novel a try, keep the old saying in mind: \"Never judge a book by its cover.\" The dainty-looking lass gracing \"The May Carousel's\" cover is Kay McCann--a promising California artist and teacher whose personality and life are anything but picture-perfect. Brandishing only a blue streak, she rescues her seemingly soft-spoken English art model, Jason Allen, from a carjacking.  Jason, like Kay, is also not what he seems because once he accepts Kay's offer to mend his wounds, his secret plan for her is hatched.  And once Kay lets Jason through her apartment door, the plan is well on its way; and soon, so are they--from L.A. to London in a tantilizing search for the man who painted Kay's portrait, Peter Lawson: an internationally-renown \"artist\" thought to be dead...until now.\"The May Carousel\" adds warmth, maturity, and a degree of realism to the spy genre. It's largely British in tone but more reminiscent of a John Buchan or Alfred Hitchcock romantic mystery than an Ian Fleming or John le Carre Cold War saga. Much like the artwork that populates the novel, author Leslie Wooddavis's characters are well-drawn. Some gravitate more toward the greater good that espionage purports to protect. But for the most part, their lives are more colorful than those living in  le Carre's gray surroundings; and their personalities, deeper than the martini-sipping swagger of the typical 007 stick figure.Kay McCann is a refreshingly humorous and self-reliant woman who is slowly drawn into suave art dealer Jason Allen's snare. But if you think Jason is the villain, again, \"Never judge a book...\" It's another high mark for Wooddavis's style: It's clever in how well it constructs its characters. Genuine love, trust, and friendship begin to sway Jason's thoughts. And Kay recovers the love, trust, and friendship that she thought was lost--felt only in fleeting flashbacks. It all makes for a potent story that builds to a truly stunning--though regrettably sensible--conclusion that will catch most readers by surprise.If the story itself is compelling, the pace lags in places--particularly in the middle. The beginning has a strong hook, with the introduction of Jake Thorton (Jason's smarmy American associate who is as adept at the art of deception as he is art dealing). Jason's wooing of Kay is a bit too involved at the start, but does the trick. But once the proceedings reach London, the novel spends too much time sorting through a love triangle. Though a few car chases and Kay's melees with would-be kidnappers help put things back in perspective, the excessive emphasis placed on romantic complexities almost undermines the greater idea: That art and romance are tactics in a bigger game being played.Still, Leslie Wooddavis triumphs in delivering a first-rate read--effective storytelling highlighted by a memorable cast of characters brought to life by a plot and dialog that  switch from sentimental to self-controlled on a dime. But best of all, \"The May Carousel\" is unique in its ability to add human warmth to the spy story scene--a genre that is typically a cold-blooded battle royal of barbs, bullets, and bombs.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "May adds warmth to typically cold-blooded spy genre", "unixReviewTime": 1323907200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011"}

The man assigned the task of making first contact knows the new race cannot be trusted and he knows that they have captured a space ship.

She gets together with her friends every Friday to watch the hot neighbor who walks around naked in his apartment without closing his curtains. They don't know his name so they call him Mr. Tool; partly because they can tell he works construction, partly because they've seen his massive \"hammer\".The hottie catches her in the parking lot and tells her he knows they've been watching him. He says she needs to come discuss the situation in private or he'll call the cops. Once inside his apartment, he gives her a choice: take him to dinner, or go to jail for peeping.Gage Warren had wanted to meet Hailey for months, then she moved out of the apartment complex and he was afraid he had missed his opportunity. Now that he's got her, he knows he doesn't ever want to let her go.Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte is a fantastic book with lava-hot sex and characters who quickly realize that what they're feeling is a lot more than mere lust. Gage and Hailey are immensely likeable because both have trouble talking to the opposite sex and both have trouble with relationships. Their imperfections make readers really care about their budding relationship. I love that they feel like they're addicted to each other. Enjoying the Show is extremely well-written and believable, and readers will love seeing Hailey and Gage explore their feelings for each other.

About as indecent as the shy and a little uptight Hailey Jennison gets, actually. She and her friends get together every Friday night for some very specific girl time. Gathering around the window in her friend's apartment, lights off, snacks and drinks in hand, they look out the window and down into the apartment of the man they refer to as Mr. Tool.The man is smoking hot and has a habit of walking around his apartment barely clothed, sometimes not clothed at all (and aren't those happy nights!), with his lights on and his shades up. Hey, a girl's gotta grab whatever salacious fun she can, right? It's harmless and he's the man of her dreams - literally. Then she goes out to get some more booze for the girl's night and Mr. Tool confronts her about her and her friends' weekly activities.Mr. Tool...Gage for those who actually know him as more than just a bit of man candy, gives Hailey an ultimatum. Either she goes out on a date with him, or he calls the cops and files a complaint about her and her friends' weekly peeping.For six months Gage has been hoping for a chance with Hailey. She had moved out of the complex before he worked up the courage to talk to her, but he caught her and her friends spying on him one night and has gone out of his way to make sure she has plenty to see ever since. True, blackmailing the woman for a date isn't exactly the most gallant thing he's ever done, but it got the job done. Finally. Now, if he can just manage to get through the date without opening his mouth and sticking one or both feet into it.To say Gage is socially awkward around women would be a gross understatement. It makes starting a relationship hard, especially when he is as attracted to a woman as he is Hailey. A little blackmail seems a small matter for his pride, though, if it gets him a shot with Hailey.~*~This deliciously erotic little bit of yumminess was fun for a hot, quick read. The plot was a bit light, and I'm not sure I bought the whole gorgeous-guy-has-to-blackmail-a-girl-for-a-date concept, but the characters were likable and the sex was abundant and hot. Sometimes, that's all I need to be happy with an erotic novella like this.I liked that there was a surprisingly plentiful cast of secondary characters. The length of the story didn't give much room for them to be fleshed out very well, but spending time with Gage's family and Hailey's friends did add a bit of depth to both main characters. Depth that I enjoyed. I was amused by the relationship between Gage and his brothers and mother. Those weekly breakfast/guilt sessions and the sibling ribbings that went on seemed very natural to the characters and situations. I enjoyed them a lot.I wish that Harte had pushed the envelope of Gage's awkwardness around women even further, because he never really struck me that way when he was around Hailey. He certainly wasn't Mr. Charming, but to have built up the level of neurosis he had over his lack of ability to speak to women without saying something wrong, I would have expected him to be much, much worse than he was. Maybe if he'd been even more blunt, or less endearing with his clumsiness, I would have bought into it a bit more.Hailey didn't do much for me, really. She didn't annoy, but she's too familiar as the uptight, tightly wound Type A personality bordering on prissy. The girl with a killer bod and an ice maiden exterior fashioned from her fear of pain. I wish more originality had gone into her character, but she at least held her own.I'm not a fan of the quick-to-love theme in romance, even in erotic novellas. That, for me, was the bigger issue with the story. I wish the romance had been given a longer lead time, even if it had been in condensed form. I also would have liked a meatier plot, and I'm no fan of relationship conflict that's nothing more than a failure to communicate, as it was here. Those are the things that held me back from completely liking what I read.It was hot, though, I'll say that. And I do have a soft spot for the themes of unrequited love (or lust) and love (lust) from afar, like Gage had for Hailey. He was kind of geeky-cute with his affections and I enjoyed that aspect very much. For a quick read that will definitely raise a gal's body temp, I'd recommend this one, but I personally would have liked more story and a less annoying conflict.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Sexy Little Bite of Yum", "unixReviewTime": 1334275200, "reviewTime": "04 13, 2012"}

She's been making goal oriented lists her entire life and never once has she failed to reach each milestone and feel a sense of accomplishment as she marks it off the `TO DO LIST.'  For the first time ever her goal of a plush corner office and her name on the letterhead of the law firm where she's been working has her considering altering her plans.  She's been working eighty hour weeks for the past year and Belle's just beginning to realize that the perks of her desired position may not be worth the sacrifices she's made.Rafe Bettencourt, Belle's brother Brian's best friend, has been a longstanding friend of the family and the object of Belle's fantasies since she was twelve years old.  It wasn't until five years ago that he began to view her as a desirable woman - before that she was simply Brian's little sister and a whole lot of fun to torment.  Rafe's perfectly aware of Belle's anal retentive, control freak nature but that's a trait he's begun to find very alluring about her - there's nothing he'd like more than to strip her naked and make her lose control.For the first time in a year, Belle has returned home to visit with her family for the holidays.  She's thinner and paler than she had been on previous visits and everyone points out the fact that she's had no time for herself, family, or anything else that makes life worth living.  Belle's perfectly aware of that fact but she's come so far and is so close to her goal - quitting now is simply inconceivable.  Rafe proves to be a delightful distraction from her own troubles as he tempts her to be naughty with him.  What better time to start up a little romance than Christmas and seeing as she'll be visiting for a full five days, he's determined to give her a good reason to make some adjustments to her `TO DO LIST.'  Adjustments that include him, a happily ever after, and all the organizing and list making she could ever desire - as long as he can seduce her into giving up her `dreams' of success in San Francisco.  Or had she already been coming to the conclusion that there's more to life than a corner office and empty apartment all on her own?  Rafe just may provide that extra push she needs to take the leap of faith and move one of her long term goals up a few notches.Lauren Dane will have readers smiling with this delightful tale of hope and promise.  TO DO LIST captures Belle's single-minded pursuit of her dreams and her lists with humor and a little sadness.  There's no doubt that she's well on her way to acquiring her goal, but she also realizes that it isn't worth giving up her `real' life to achieve and accepting that she isn't going to get to cross that goal off her list is difficult to accept.  Rafe is willing to accept Belle exactly as she is - organized shoes and all - but he's also aware that the path she's on is a destructive and lonely one.  Rather than try to tell her what she should do he presents her with feasible options which may make her happier.  I had a great time reading TO DO LIST especially since I'm guilty of making these infamous lists myself.  I loved the family aspect of this story and the way it makes you see that there are more important things in life than reaching every goal you set for yourself - there's health, family, love, and your own happiness.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "delightful tale of hope and promise.", "unixReviewTime": 1205884800, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2008"}

Lauren Dane is one of my favorite authors and I think this was the first totally contemporary romance that I have read written by her.  To Do List made me giggle simply because I COULD HAVE BEEN Belle.  Famous in my family for my lists, I so empathized with her need to be organized and loved how her quirkiness endeared her to Rafe.

She wanted the great love, passion, and excitement.  She almost had it all in Parker West, but he was predictable, boring, and proposed to her in a most unromantic way.  Celia was not selfish, but she refused to settle for less than everything, so she turned down the unacceptable proposal.  When Parker showed up at her front door, tied her up, and carried her off to an unknown location, she was frightened, but yet excited by his spontaneity.Parker was risking everything on this last chance effort.  He had known the difficult Celia all his life, and being a kind gentleman had gotten him nowhere, so he hoped unleashing his darker dominant side might penetrate her steel defenses.  When they arrived at his cabin, she responded to this side of him better than he could have ever anticipated.  If he would have known this was all it took, he would have introduced this aspect of his sexuality years ago.  His next proposal, although done while both of them were naked and in bed, was readily accepted.When neighbor Rance Colter tried to stop the quickie wedding in town, Parker knew it was only a sign of things to come.  He knew that Rance had wanted to claim Celia for his own, but she had never wanted him in return.  Now that Celia was his, Parker set up extra protection at his ranch as well as Celia's.  He didn't put anything past Colter, and knew he would try something soon.  Her being married would not stop him.  That is one thing Parker had no doubt about.  When Celia was abducted from home, both families swore she would be returned unharmed whatever the cost.A traditional formula that works well with this story.

I borrowed the hard copy, and enjoyed it so much, I immediately bought the Bundle so I would have all the books, and all in the same place. I will be buying more of Ms. Snyder's books!These books are what I would call High Fantasy, though there are no dragons. There are Sorcerers, Magicians, and of course, Mundanes - no dragons. I believe they would easily cross to a genre I seldom read and even more seldom enjoy, Romance.As I read fiction for escape, this was perfect! I could escape into a world lush with characters, geography, and conflict.Poison Study starts off with our heroine, Yelena, being brought out of her cell in the dungeon to stand before the #2 man of the country. He gives her a choice. She can face the executioner for her crime of killing the son of a noble, or she can face the possibility of a slow and agonizing death at some future date, and become the official taster of the Commander (who runs the country.)Because there might be a way for her to escape, and this is at the beginning of the story, she accepts the latter. An honest person, she wins either the fast and loyal friendship of many, or the undying hatred.When the Commander took over the country, he outlawed all magic, seeing it as evil, and any who had abilities either did their best to escape to Ixia, where magic was not only allowed, but nurtured, or were killed trying.As the story unfolds, we learn Yelena was an orphan, taken and raised under the protection and education of General Brazell (whose son she killed). By the end of the story, we learn she was not an orphan, but had been kidnapped for her hoped for, and anticipated, magical abilities.Life for Yelena was not pleasant in the orphanage, and only slightly more pleasant as a Taster, but at least it was life.Magic Study finds Yelena reunited with her birth family, and on her way to learning to use and control her magic. Again, her choice is: Learn to use it, or burn yourself out, unless killed first.In Magic Study, she finds herself in a strange place, untrusted, even by her brother, accused of being a spy, with few friends, and a nasty habit of charging ahead without thinking everything through.Fire Study is the third and final book in the trilogy. Yelena finds her true magic, which frightens everyone, including her. She is a Soulfinder, one of the most powerful of all magics. By now all the characters are known, or at least most of them, and we're aware of Yelena's foibles, and her undying loyalties.She tries to avert a war, is caught, imprisoned, escapes, and has a price on her head. The First Magician wants her dead, the Fire Starter wants her soul, and the Commander's Assassin wants her.For the most part, this was a page burner. Once I started reading it, it was very difficult to put down. So why only 4 stars? Because Ms. Snyder knows better than to use lazy language such as, \"Me and him...\" and the 3d and final book had entirely too many of those. Each time I read that phrase, it threw me out of the story, and I had to work my way back in. It jarred. The more of them I read, the stronger the jar.Although \"Me and....\" drives me crazy, it may not bother you. Perhaps that is the way you speak and write, and you have no idea it is the epitome of laziness in the use of American English; if so, it won't bother you, and you will probably not even notice.The stories were great fun.

She just needs some time and space to figure out what she wants for the rest of her life, and whether or not her feelings for Ethan are real or just a by-product of their close friendship.Ethan has been waiting for the right opportunity to let Sophia know just how he feels about her.  Having been careful to give her space in which to grieve her late husband, he has bided his time in reluctant patience - he'll be damned if he misses his chance with her now.  Determined to finally make his move and tell the lovely widow just how much she means to him, he moves heaven and earth to land himself on the same cruise.  He'll pull out all the stops to make both of their dreams come true, praying that those dreams will be possible together.Home for Christmas is an absolutely wonderful tale about a mature romance between two friends who have long loved each other from afar.  With a starring couple who are both over forty, Kate Davies offers a realistic look at love the second time around for those of us who are long past the first bloom of youth, but still young enough to entertain dreams of love and forever.As a no-nonsense widow and the mother of a young adult daughter, Sophia is mindful of her family's needs, while still being very aware of her own as a woman.  When the death of her husband left her as part-owner in his business, she never hesitated to roll up her sleeves and work in the family business alongside her friend and partner, Ethan.  She knows Ethan would do anything for her, but worries that her growing romantic ideas about him are born of their close proximity and her dependence on his presence in her life.  While she is ready to admit her feelings, she needs time away to be sure of them before running the risk of damaging their friendship.Of course, Ethan wouldn't be our story's hero if he let her get away with that.  The man is romantically relentless, determined that he won't spend Christmas apart from the woman he loves more than anything.  Even still, he gives her every chance to keep him at arm's length once he arrives on board the cruise ship, while hoping deep down inside that she doesn't take those opportunities.  But Ethan means to make this relationship last for the rest of their lives, and his resolve that Sophia be sure of not just his feelings for her but hers for him are heart-warming.Home for Christmas is a wonderfully inspiring romance that will make readers rejoice in the belief that new life and new love can most certainly happen no matter your age.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "4.5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques", "unixReviewTime": 1206230400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2008"}

It also doesn't have any sex scenes and character development is shallow at best, with the exception of the heroine, Heather.Heather is the human mate to two wolf shapeshifters; when buying supplies, Heather, friend and shapeshifter Niko and her mates' father are ambushed by hunters.  To make a short story shorter, Heather is blamed by her mates who think she was responsible for the attack which ended in their father's death.  She's gravely injured, yet they turn their back on her and leave her to die.  She's rescued by a hunter (a good one this time) who tries to nurse her back to life.What follows is standard typical romance stuff and would be spoilers, if that's possible.  What makes this story very good for me is more about what's left out.  This isn't erotica, despite the steamy books Banks usually writes.  I don't know if it could even be called a romance, since there's not a lot of romancing going on.  It's more of a love story; characters torn apart because of a misunderstanding and brought back together not because of hot sex, but rather love and the ability to forgive.  I didn't particularly like the mates and if it were me, they'd have been kicked back to the pack and I'd have run off with Niko.This isn't a perfect story; things get wrapped up far too soon and because of the length and that fact that nearly all of the narrative focuses on Heather, her mates get the short end of the stick in terms of character development.  They go from feeling betrayed to wallowing in grief because of what they did in a very, very short amount of time.

They will do anything to make it up to Heather and earn her forgiveness, but is it too late?  Has her trust in them been irrevocably broken?Leave it to Maya Banks to have me bawling my eyes out over the Christmas holiday.  With her holiday release, Love Me, Still, Ms. Banks tore my heart to shreds.  Between my past experience with this author's stories and the publisher's synopsis, I really should have expected as much, in hindsight.Never has Maya Banks' ability to instill empathy for her characters in the reader been more evident than in this story.  I felt everything that Heather felt.  I ached when she ached for the loss of her mates.  I sobbed when she cried over the hurt she saw in her mates' eyes when they believed she had betrayed them.  And when they returned to her, I felt the same joy Heather did at her return to the mates and the pack she so cherished.In the midst of all that raw emotion, it never occurred to me what the story didn't have.  It wasn't until later as I reminisced over the story that it struck me - this is the first Maya Banks title I have ever read that has no sex scene.  You read that right - none whatsoever.  And you know what?  As much as I have enjoyed this author's undeniable talent at crafting love scenes that would melt the paint off a car, I didn't even notice it wasn't there while I read the story.  It worked very well without it.  In fact, I would venture so far to say that if adding a sex scene to this story meant cutting any other part of the tale, I would absolutely not want it.  Love Me, Still was that perfect.  If anyone should doubt Maya Banks' writing talent, this story can be held up as a prime example of her ability to stir emotions without needing sex to do so.When I am in the mood for a good tearjerker with a beautiful love story featuring the reuniting of lovers, Love Me, Still will be the book I reach for time and again.**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques", "unixReviewTime": 1206230400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2008"}

And Tara Patrick definitely fits under the good thing category.  Scott has been biding his time just waiting for his chance to show Tara they can be more than just friends.  With her recent break-up from her louse of a boyfriend and her subsequent need to show the bum she is serious about the break-up, Scott offers himself up to play the part of her new boyfriend.  Of course, Scott just happens to be into method acting, and this is the role of his lifetime...Tara isn't so sure about Scott's plan - especially when it involves moving in with him, albeit temporarily.  But when his family makes her a business offer that is too good to be true, she can't refuse.  One little problem: how will she ever be able to keep her hands off her hunky friend while living in such close proximity?  Scott could never be interested in a woman like her - could he?Fans of Annmarie McKenna's work will be delighted when they recognize the hero of Look What Santa Brought as the very same Scott Wyatt we first met in her book Blackmailed.  Yes, this is the same Scott that is Brianna's little brother!  Of course, this new story takes place years later and Scott is one very sexy adult man now, ready for his own shot at romance with the woman of his dreams.Scott has certainly grown up right, now running his own business and enjoying life almost to the fullest.  The only thing missing in his life is love.  Sure, his looks pave the way for him with most women, but many regard him as nothing more than a curious fling due to his blindness.  Tara is one of the few women that treats him just like any other man, which he most certainly is.  Despite his disability, Scott is more than capable of taking care of both himself and the woman he loves.Tara is a woman in a situation many of us have unexpectedly found ourselves in at one time of having suddenly found herself in a potentially abusive relationship.  Determined to rid herself of the man trying to control her life and stand on her own, she is at first understandably reluctant to accept Scott's offer to help.  That reluctance only increases as things take a dangerous turn and she is unwilling to put either Scott or his family at risk.  Of course, the valiant Scott is not one to take no for an answer, especially regarding the safety of the woman he has loved for so long.Although a short story, Look What Santa Brought affords us a `where are they now' glimpse into the lives of Scott's sister and her men, reinforcing one happy ever after while delivering another in the form of Scott and Tara's relationship.This sexy little story may have a holiday theme, but Look What Santa Brought is undeniably a story that will be enjoyed by romance fans no matter the time of year. I know it will enjoy a permanent place in my library so I may re-read it at will in the years to come.Connected Stories:Blackmailed**This story can also be found in the print anthologyThe Perfect Gift**", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "5 Klovers - Courtesy of CK2S Kwips & Kritiques", "unixReviewTime": 1206230400, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2008"}

I hope you'll also note the publisher's review that implies very mild BDSM and lots and lots of sex.  Don't download this book if you're gonna have a problem with sex on a first date, explicit sexual language and graphic descriptions of sex or people having, you know, sex.To call this a PNR is a stretch because it's way too erotic to be a romance.  And apparently it's not erotic enough to be called erotica for some picky people.  If the rest of the story is only a conveyance to get the couple in bed, in my mind that's erotica even if it's tame.Okay, so now if you're still interested, please get this book!  You won't be disappointed.  This is a straightforward story with a very simple plot.  It's not superior storytelling; I would have liked more character development on both sides, and the dialogue is not great.  But, ultimately, I read erotica so I can get jazzed up and go jump my husband; this book definitely, erm, scored in that regard.  I hate contrived drama between the male and female who could clear everything up if they only talked about their feelings or asked the right question.  The couple in this story had a problem and voila, they talked about it so they could move on to the good part.  What a concept.So, yes, the sex, there's a lot of it.  Just because nobody gets a ball gag in their mouth doesn't mean it's not hot.

To do this, they need the assistance of some humans in the entertainment industry.  They decide to go with Calypso Productions, but the meeting is a disaster.  In the end, Luke asks one of the women to meet again somewhere else, hoping he can convince her to help in a less formal setting.  The woman, Lena, asks him to dinner.  Though he's nervous--and attracted to Lena--Luke agrees.Lena has risen to a position of influence as a founding member of Calypso Productions.  Together with her three friends, she's one of Hollywood's young elite.  Normally she would blow off a guy who gives a presentation as awkwardly as Luke and his friends did.  Since she finds him attractive, however, she asks him to dinner with the intention of seducing him.  Will Lena still want Luke when she discovers what he and his friends are?Lights, Camera...Monsters is a cute and interesting tale of what happens when an up-and-coming Hollywood businesswoman meets a monster, literally.  Lena is secure in her own place in the world, and proud of her accomplishments.  She's tough and knows what she wants.  Luke, with his mixture of toughness and tenderness, confidence and vulnerability, throws her for a loop.  The scene in which she first sees Luke's true form is really funny.  I liked Luke's navet&eacute; regarding human customs, and his uncertainty.  He softened some of Lena's grating edges.  The storyline itself is engaging, with lots of sex, some action and suspense, and a rather unusual take on the paranormal/monster genre.  Secondary characters, including Luke's friends and Lena's business partners, are clearly destined for their own stories.  If you like the paranormal but are getting tired of the same old creatures, Lights, Camera...Monsters is a good choice.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Lights, Camera...

The first chapter takes place at work and Lena literally doesn't work for the rest of the book.  The world of work presented here isn't realistic either.  It just doesn't make sense that five college friends, all in their twenties, would be able to set up a super successful Hollywood production company - especially when they rely on their receptionist to set up meetings for them and he does it on the basis of whether or not the guys are cute.  This is far from a minor detail in the book - Lena's job is supposedly how she meets the male main character in the first place.It was disturbing how quickly Lena adopted Luke as a \"pet,\" buying him clothes, telling people to keep their hands off of him, being charmed by his failure to understand human society (and while we're at it, why bother to create a whole new class of beings for your books but then stick with the whole \"he doesn't really understand humans/good sex mates him for life/he is violently possessive\" thing that plagues most PNRs?), and telling her friends (in front of him!) very specific details about how good he is in bed.  I'm so sick of the message that all every woman of minimal accomplishment wants is a guy who will be willing to have slightly deviant sex with her while being so turned on by her that he'll feel compelled to rape her when he even imagines her with another man (which, yes, actually happens here).  While this might not work with an actual woman, Lena is a bit more one-dimensional.  She's sassy!  She's been hurt by men!  She's always on a diet!  She likes mochas!  Her living room is decorated with high heeled shoes and knick knacks from Anthropologie!  She's presumably JUST LIKE YOU or JUST LIKE YOU WOULD WANT TO BE, all she needs is a monster to make her complete (and maybe rape her on the couch!)The plot doesn't really exist other than the sex - there's a flimsy and easily resolved conflict and the rest of the time is spent setting up Lena's beautiful and super cool friends to star in future books.  They're women of accomplishment also, so it should be no time before they realize that their entire life was worthless until they met a macho monster to dominate them.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Boring", "unixReviewTime": 1311120000, "reviewTime": "07 20, 2011"}

The writing was decent and I did like the character of Luke but the story could still use some work. This edition could still use some editing and the author has the annoying tendency of constantly identifying the characters rather than switching to he or she after the first few times. It pulled me out of the story occasionally but it's not a major issue. The sex does tend to go on for a while but there are some definitely hot moments. The whole scene with Luke in his \"monster\" form was pretty ridiculous but it didn't ruin the entire book for me. I got a little confused with all the characters thrown into this story (obviously to set up future books in the series) with 5 best friends including Lena plus Luke and his 2 buddies I couldn't really keep up with who's who when they all got together. There's a small bit of action in the story but Luke's quest to make this movie doesn't actually happen in this story, I'm sure it's going to be prolonged over the course of the series so be warned this is definitely a story about Lena and Luke's relationship or sex life really than anything else.

They're hip, trendy, and current, and they're building a stellar name for themselves in the industry by focusing on quality entertainment. She is always on the lookout for promising new clients, but never had that promise held more appeal than when three utterly delicious men walk into the conference room. It may have been the worst sales pitch she'd ever heard, but the apparent front man of the three, a stunningly gorgeous man named Luke, stirs all sorts of juices in Lena. Despite the waste of time the meeting turns out to be professionally, she suggests a further discussion between the two of them that night over dinner.It wouldn't have been difficult for the dinner to go much better than the meeting had, but even Lena is surprised to find out that above and beyond how attractive she finds Luke physically, she is even more entertained by his companionship. Their chemistry is off the charts and the sex is phenomenal. There is, in fact, nothing that could dim the exquisite memory of the best night of her life...until she wakes up, rolls over, opens her eyes, and sees a seven-foot tall, winged, fanged, shaggy monster in bed next to her.That's pretty much when the screaming starts.Convinced some monster had eaten her new lover, Lena is both terrified and pissed, and it takes a hurt and embarrassed Luke a while to calm her down enough to explain that he hadn't been eaten and he is, in fact, a monster. And that he and his friends had come to her company in desperate hope that they could help launch a preemptive campaign to prepare humanity for their existence without sparking panic and causing the relentless slaughter of the last of his kind.Hollywood: gateway to public opinion and recent home to a sex god of a monster. Lena does so love that town.I have to admit, a quick read of the product description of the book before I downloaded it to my Kindle gave me the impression thatLights, Camera...Monstersis a paranormal romance. I should've payed closer attention to the warning, because this is definitely an erotic paranormal romance. It's an important distinction; a fact made crystal clear when I wasn't anticipated it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I like erotic paranormal romance. But in this case, it created a few problems for me.It's not just about the amount of sex in the book, which is a lot, or the level of graphic description, also a lot. Nor is it the light kink, which was fine. It was the fact that all of those things combined and became the largest part of the story by far, substituting romance for sex, eclipsing an anemic external conflict plot thread, providing virtually no character development, and overwhelming the limited world building and mythos creation.The concept of the story is a bit kitschy and kooky, but it is definitely original. The characters were ill-defined and two dimensional, but endearing (especially Luke). There was more than one plot hole, but the guilty pleasure I took in the humor and random bouts of comedy kept me from focusing too heavily on it. And the external conflict was appallingly bereft of development and was so quickly resolved it was laughable, yet...I can't deny that I found it all rather entertaining.I had a hard time believing that the monsters call their species monsters, though. That bothered me a lot, and didn't make a lot of sense in the big picture. They have their own language and their own culture, have hidden themselves away from people, but they define their species based on human preconceptions and labels? That didn't track for me.Yet despite the drawbacks, I found myself oddly drawn in and more than a little captivated by Luke in particular, whose intense efforts to fit in completely charmed me more than once. I wish there had been more time allotted to Luke and Michael and Henry together, because their scenes were showstoppers. And I didn't detest Lena, which is definitely a point in the books favor.In truth, I wish I had started the book with the advanced awareness of its erotic nature, because I think my expectations would have been different and I would have enjoyed the read even more. That being said, I can't complain at the price I paid (gotta love those free Kindle downloads), and don't feel like it was a waste of time. In fact, there was enough promise and potential in DuBois' writing that I'm interested in checking out the rest of the series in the hopes that the smutty, sexual, lightly kinky fun shares the page with a more well-rounded and better conceived plot and fully formed characters.Warning: This book contains graphic scenes of sex and alternative sexual situations including but not limited to: light BDSM, anal sex, and monster sex.

The prologue doesn't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book, it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature, and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words.  Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell.  Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die.  Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there.  Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now.  Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it.  Geyron could not help, even though he desperately wanted to.  In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer, one she would later realize was a mistake.  While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords, Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings, desires, and wants for one another.  This is where it starts to get messy.

I just wasn't feeling the draw at all. Even creepy as he seemed more animal than human.The idea that Pandora's box was built from a Goddess' bones was really cool and I think that I may have enjoyed The Darkest Fire more if I had read it after the first book in the series, The Darkest Night.

I have read nothing of the series but bought the \"Lords of the Underworld\" bundle that has this book and the first three books.  I read a reviewer's note that said if you get the sample of this bundle that you will get the entire short story/prequel in that sample (word to the wise).  Of course that would only be helpful for people who have read the rest of the series and didn't want to buy the prequel.  For me, I just decided to delve into this series so I didn't mind getting it in the bundle.It has some pretty low reviews.  Normally I would never buy and probably wouldn't read a book or novella that has 3 stars.  I am pretty surprised it has such low reviews, but perhaps people were hoping for more from this prequel.This story is about the guardian to the gates of Hell (Geryon) and the goddess of oppression, Kadence who is in charging of maintaining the wall between the human realm and Hell.  The wall has a crack in it and Kadence bargains with Lucifer to allow Geryon to help her repair it.  Only the very end does it bring up Pandora's box (from what I can gather, the point of the story was to give us the background on Pandora's box, but I am not sure if Geryon or Kadence play any role in the rest of the books).I plan to read the next book, The Darkest Night next.
